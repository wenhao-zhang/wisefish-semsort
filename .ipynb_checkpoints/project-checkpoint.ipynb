    "SemSort utilizes two natural language processing artificial intelligence techniques to automatically aggregate reviews for given business into quickly digestible lists. Review summarization is done using an improved SumBasic algorithm, a multidocument summarization tool. Semantic Analysis is carried out by a neural network trained to predict the positive or negative sentiment of sentence. SemSort is a tool to provide additional subjective information to reviews, offering an extension to Yelp’s star rating system."

    "The motivation for SemSort came out of an interest to learn more about the topics of sentiment analysis and text summarization. Our group wanted to test the effectiveness of different models all the while implementing something practical. After viewing the Yelp dataset we came up with the idea of SemSort. Once we confirmed that this was a relatively unique combination of the two NLP areas of study, we decided to to pursue it as our project.  "

After discussing several topics and potential datasets, we eventually settled on using text summarization and sentiment analysis on the yelp reviews dataset. We drew the required pipeline that we would need to follow (see SemSort Pipeline below). After that, we divided up the tasks and set a deadline for ourselves and another meeting date to discuss any final obstacles as well as notebook and poster documentation. "

    "The class used for preprocessing the input for summarization is called ProcessData. The initialization function takes in 6 inputs. The first input variable data, is the data that needs to be processed. The type_pos_tag variable determines the type of POS tagger to be used. The default input is NLTK, this used the built in pos tagger from nltk. Setting this variable to Stanford will switch to using the Stanford pos tagger. The remove_short feature removes sentences that are too short. The lemmatize variable enables or disables lemmatization. True will use lemmatization. Lemmatization is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed together as a single unit. We found this to help the quality of summarization from SumBasic. The remove_stop_word variable will cause stop words to be removed if it is set to true. Stop words are those words that do not provide much information. In our case we justed the NLTK english stop words. The remove_punc variable will remove all punctuations if it is set to true. This was helpful for SumBasic as we found if we did not remove the punctuation, they would skew the results. Some of the reviews on Yelp were just some punctuations.\n",

We specifically look at Rouge-N which measures the overlap in the n-grams between our generated summary and one or more gold standard models in the dataset. The dataset that we used for testing is the [Opinosis dataset](http://kavita-ganesan.com/opinosis-opinion-dataset/#.XAM97BB6ov4) which has an attached research paper with which we can compare results."

We could also try to run sentiment analysis on the data before summarization. This would categorize the data into positive and negative. This could potential provide us better summaries. Another thing we could do is perform some feature extraction."
