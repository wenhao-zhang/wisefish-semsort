0,"It's a solid mall but it can have a ton of foot traffic.The good: While this is not the only place in Toronto to do some great shopping, you can find a lot of amazing stores. Unless you are looking for something very specific, you can get it here. Old Navy, Harry Rosen, Indigo, Apple, Oakley, Sport Chek... easy to meet all your needs.They recently upgraded the food court and it's great. The space is elegant and huge. There are a ton of options for grub whether you want something quick and dirty or something of higher quality.Being downtown, the mall is very easy to access. The Eaton Centre is well connected to public transportation - two subway stations (at either end), street cars, and buses. If you really need to drive, there is a parking garage in the mall.The bad: Traffic, traffic, traffic... This place can be a zoo depending on the time of day or year. Sometimes I have just walked in and walked out because of how busy this place can be. You get a combination of people who are there to shop, who are there to wander, and there just to kill time until they go to a baseball, hockey game, or show. If you are in a bad mood or in a rush, think twice before going in."
1,i love that this mall is connected to the train stations so it's super convenient to get to especially when its freezy outside. i came here mainly to shop at roots.. but like most mall stores.. sizes are limited and its crowded. i think its super cool that there is a shoppers inside. i found my lays ketchup chips here for 1.88 a bag. how awesome is that?!the mall doesn't have a lot of directories so it's kind of confusing.. but if u want to shop inside and have variety.. this is the place to go!
2,"The Toronto Eaton Centre is Toronto's largest mall - so its going to be busy with lots of people (interesting, goodlooking, weirdos, etc).Some shops in the Toronto Eaton Centre can be found in other malls but they have some  unique stores that are not in the rest of the GTA.Prices are on par with other malls/stores outside of the Eaton Centre.There is a lot of food options with 2 food courts i think, and a couple of restaurants (baton rouge).  Overall I think the Toronto Eaton Centre is for mall lovers, if you love big crowds, this is your place.Things I don't like - the washrooms are nothing special, and there isn't enough table and chairs in the food courts during peak hours (lunch, evening).Personally - I wouldn't travel all the way from Brampton or any other city to go to the Toronto Eaton Centre - but thats because I'm not a mall rat!"
3,"Lots of stores, always very busy regardless of time of day.  The Queen subway station is attatched to the mall so it is very convenient.  Large food court with many different international cuisines.Many higher-end stores like Michael Kors, Guess, MAC, and nice shoe stores.  People from all walks of life end up in the Eaton Centre, including homeless people.  Just be careful as they can sometimes be aggressive or confrontational.  Some people who aren't from Toronto aren't used to this so I'd recommend just being aware and extra careful after making an expensive purchase or carrying lots of bags when alone.There are lots of security officials and Toronto police around the mall at all times, but you can never be too careful."
4,"The Eaton Centre is the only big ""mall"" in the downtown core, so it ends up being:a) a HUGE tourist attractionand b) a magnet if you live downtown and you need to buy anything.There are so many days when I am running errands and I'll manage to get everything on my list from places that are NOT the Eaton Centre...but then that last thing...and I'm sucked in.All in all, it's not a bad mall. It has a decent selection of mall stores, and high-end ones to please the snobs (although the Coach store always smells like urine. I don't know why, but it's revolting).If I can offer one tip on the Eaton Centre, it is to avoid weekends. Fridays and Saturdays are a nightmare, Sundays aren't quite as bad, but generally the weekend sucks because it is when all the GTA people commute into the city, pay $20 for parking, and shop to their heart's content. And they're entitled to do that. I'd just shop in the morning instead."
5,Always a bustling place with premium shopping.  And various activities outside the centre are always interesting.  Today i got free pack of Hersey's S'mores pudding!!!
6,"I was a tourist in Toronto recently so I stood in front of the billboards outside of the Eaton Centre, near where native music was being performed, and smiled for a cell phone camera. Close by, men on motorcycles lingered together. A *certain* skunky smell filled the air for a quick moment as a group walked by. And then, I headed into the mall....And it looked like a mall. With many levels. And I kept getting confused by the levels and rando-steps and half-escalators. Mainly because, you know, I was the tourist in this situation. I was allowed to be puzzled by the newness of this set-up. Or.. something like that. Excuses here.So anyway, this place has some pretty neat stores. I really liked Indigo Books in particular. The Eaton Centre also boasts plenty of your well-known names, like H&M and Zara.I'd say if you're visiting Toronto, you should probably stick your head in to say you've been there. But it's nothing exceptionally spectacular. It does have a central location downtown, however, so if you find yourself in need of, say, socks on your vacation, there are plenty of shoe stores at the ready to sell you some socks here!"
7,"This is a tourist hotspot! I used to come here when I was younger just because I was mesmerized at the beauty of downtown. There's every store you could think of and they just keep expanding it! Whether it's inside Eaton Centre or just outside around Dundas Square - there's always something going on. Stores range from high end to cheap steals, so you can definitely kill a whole afternoon going from one end of the mall to the other.Now since my university is actually an extension of the top 3 floors of Eaton Centre, I'm pretty sick of this mall. The heat is always cranked up so I don't advice bringing a jacket or wearing too many layers. The entire mall spans from Dundas Station to Queen Station (and further if you include Hudson Bay and Saks Fifth as part of Eatons). There's rooftop parking and other parking garages in the area, but it's easiest to travel here by Subway. From the subway or the Path, you never have to step food outside.There's free wifi, but it's pretty bad. Individual store wifi is much better. Mall security here is also really uptight - I guess because it's downtown? I've done city-wide scavenger hunts and ""amazing race"" type activities in this location and they will kick you out. This mall is always busy, and the best and worst time of the year to come is during the holidays when you can appreciate the decorations and large Christmas tree!"
8,"If you happen to live downtown and want to walk to a shopping mall, this place is fine.  If not there is no reason to visit it.  For locals, all the stores are more or less duplicated elsewhere and for tourists, the high end shopping of Yorkville on the one hand or the bargains of Kensington Market on the other are  much more interesting.  The glass ceiling is kind of pretty and worth a few pics, but that is about all.  I have no idea why tourist guides even feel the need to mention this place in more than a passing listing of area shopping malls."
9,"Easily accessible! Can walk underground through the tunnels and taxis are readily available! They have a wide selection of stores!! Yes, they have zara, roots and even face shop!Huge food court at the very bottom floor! Seriously, any food you're craving, there's a restaurant for it!"
10,"Eatons is probably one of the biggest tourist attraction places in Toronto, and taking that into consideration, the workers here are relatively nice.They carry a variety of brands, from low end to high end. It has Holt, Saks, and the Bay. Sephora here is definitely my favourite due to the size and selection, but sales associates at this Sephora is the rudest I've encountered in Canada.Food court is at the lowest level, lots of choices."
11,"This shopping center is massive. There are three floors of stores and restaurants, and it would take days to shop the whole center. It's location does make it a great place to stop for some food on the way to the next tourist destination, if you are visiting the city as a tourist. The food court is always crowded though. I highly recommend finding a table first and having a friend save your seat as you get your food, otherwise you will have food to eat and no place to eat it."
12,"A man and clothes shopping never fit together. Add a girl or your mom and the situation can turn ugly. During my long shopping day at the Eaton Centre, I went with my mom, my brother, and my brother's girlfriend. After a great lunch at St. Louis, we began our adventure.To begin our shopping spree, we first entered The Face Shop. Initially I did not want to enter the store but did not want to be alone waiting. The only guys in sight were my brother and me. Trying to maintain my manly composure, I awkwardly continued to accompany the girls. After minutes of waiting and watching the girls decide which lotion best suits their needs, we left buying something (don't really know what).Venturing around The Eaton Centre, we shopped at J Crew and Nine West but came out empty handed. When we arrrived at Roots, we were greeted with a long lineup awaiting us. Impatient and unable to wait, we left and continue to shop.We stumbled upon The Bay and entered for more shop/walk. Arriving at the shoe section, my brother and me sat down in nearby seats while the girls continued their shop for shoes.Several minutes later we left without purchasing a shoe. In dire need of a drink after a long day of walking, we purchase Shaken Iced Tea from Starbucks. The drink was refreshing and iced cold. The shaken iced tea was excellent to end my shopping adventure.The Eaton Centre is filled with stores tailored made for a female. Although I came out emptied handed, I still found the shopping adventure to be worthwhile. If you are a female in dire need of clothes, sally forth towards the Eaton Centre"
13,"I'd reccommend public transportion (especially the subway) to get to Eaton Centre since as far as I know, there isn't much, if any, free parking. Even though the Eaton Centre is an iconic mall, I honestly wouldn't recommend it unless you're a tourist. It's overwhelmingly huge... but it's not worth the sore feet. I'd recommend going to Yorkdale (my #1 fav) or Vaughan Mills, where you still get all the stores, but without the ridiculous size. The planning and layout is super weird too. They also have really random stores like Canadian Tire.The Eaton Centre is also super outdated and I never feel like it's super clean either."
14,"Who wouldn't love this place?I mean it isn't any outlet center but it does deck itself up quitenice during the holidays. The whole little district outside of theEaton Center makes me a tad warm and fuzzy for being in Toronto.Probably because it reminds me of being in Halifax all in one street.For the most part, whose going to complain about the shops themselveswithin the Eaton Center? As for the center itself, I found it ratherdifficult to navigate around in there. Realistically, it is probablyjust me and my lack of direction in unvisited places. I couldn't findthe bathrooms, I couldn't find the food, I was a mess. On the verge ofa broken bladder and an empty stomach, forced to grab a smoothie thatwas full of sugar, and couldn't decide between Victoria Secret orLocale purchases. The HORROR!No but really, I didn't find there was a good solid amount of signageletting a girl know where the food court is. All that kept runningthrough my mind was... 'they have to have more than a starbucks and aBP!' I later found the entire bottom level was food, only after I hada large yogen fruz.I could get used to it. No question. Taking my 3 to a 4 to a 5."
15,"On our one day trip to Toronto, we decided to go to the mall in the morning to shop a bit before we headed down to CN Tower and explore the other areas. I really liked how spacious the mall was. Great stores on 3 levels. The reason I am giving this one star instead of anything better, is because I went to use the restroom before we left the mall and it had to have been the dirtiest, most disgusting restroom I have ever been in. I mean, airport restrooms are much cleaner than this. Thinking this mall is fairly clean, let me use the rest room here. I walked in and my goodness, there was toilet paper ALL OVER literally in every stall. Water or god knows what was on the floors. I mean just flat out filthy and gross. This is definitely not sanitary and should be reported to the city... Which I might actually do. Just thinking about it, makes me sick to my stomach. I walked out of there with the disgusted look on my face and told my boyfriend that I refuse to use the restroom there."
16,favourite mall ever since.  it can get pretty really busy and tons of people but the place is huge so lots of space. lots of walking. lots of good stores. my favourite store is the forever 21 there. i did all my shopping and im happy about it even if i spend a lot of money lol.( i dont go here that much. my first time again after 3 years. im from kingston lol) my husband just love the blue jays store he went nuts about the store lol
17,"We happened upon this shopping emporium after my daughter asked out Lyft driver where to find a decent mall. That's was an understatement.There's a store for anything and everything here. The crowds were manageable, washing rooms very clean, and the food court all-encompassing for nearly any type of cuisine you'd desire while shopping.We spent a few hours and a few dollars as well, but watching the interesting individuals that populate this Toronto destination for shopping is a real treat."
18,"I still classify this as a tourist mall but it still has its practicalities.  It's a tourist attraction so ya it will be open when other malls are closed sometimes...  It's a huge mall, huge.  Restaurants, stores, a subway station at either end but it's most convenient to just traverse though say from Queen to Dundas while staying inside. Renovations?  Chains?  This place has both in what seems to be a forever type thing.  The Hudson's Bay on the Queen end and whatever US based department store on the Dundas side.  Open spaces, multiple levels, see through elevators and a renovated Urban Eatery.  How new is this place?  The Richtree open market cafeteria style restaurant has taken over the older dungeon type bottom floor mini-open concept type of eatery what once was the old tucked away overcrowded and noisy southern food court.  My favorite entrance/exit has to be the side with Trinity Square side that leads towards City Hall and Trinity Church.There is no more Eaton's (to which the entire mall was named) which was the department store at the Dundas end of the mall but the name lives on.Update:  Eaton's formally Sears north side department store will be Nordstroms."
19,"At the age of thirty-meh, you can understand that I'm not quite a mall-rat.  I've lost my loitering gene but when I'm in a mood to shop, I quite fancy the Eaton Centre.  It provides me with a few criteria that I feel are musts; great variety of shops, decent organization, and it's walking distance from my house.Centrally located and on the Toronto subway line, it's by far the easiest mall to get to.  The food court is moderately inoffensive as food courts go, but thankfully there are some okay sit-down restaurants if you fancy something a little less tray-oriented.The division of the shops is by level it seems, the more inexpensive shops and more generic franchises found on the lower level, with the more expensive shops finding themselves on the literal and metaphorical higher tiers of the mall.  Bookended on the north and south sides by Sears and The Bay respectively, you're usually able to find some form of clearance sale or other from either end.  An easy way to kill off a Saturday."
20,"Eaton Centre is like a point of reference for anyone going to Toronto just like the CN Tower. It's a huge, behemoth of a structure that currently is getting a makeover and houses hundreds of shops and restaurants. That being said, it's a mall. Just a mall. There are lots of other stores around the city to check out."
21,"Yeah, it's big.  Got it.  If I were a twelve year old tourist from someplace with no malls I would think that Jesus lived here.  But generally speaking there are maybe two stores here I ever need to go into, and I'd just as soon they were standalone stores as this monstrosity.To be fair, I never understood the urge to stroll a mall as entertainment - they are gross, with shitty florescent lights and bad overpriced greasy food.  And there's never, ever a bathroom.  Even when it's not the dreaded 8 month ""holiday season"" it's stressful and panic inducing.  And really, I can't think of anything more embarrassing than the fact that a huge chunk of our downtown core is dedicated shopping center space.  Showing friends in from out of town the ""downtown"" is like this: ""Oh do you like malls? No? Oh well I guess don't go on Yonge Street between Richmond and Gerrard.""I bet it brings in a gazillion dollars, yes.  For tourists who come to shop in stores they have in slightly less density in their own home malls.  For any other purpose this mall could be in any other part of the city.  So let's get on the phone and see if anyone can figure out how to move it, ok?"
22,"One thing I have found particularly worrying about Toronto as a travel destination is how predominantly Eaton Centre is mentioned as a tourist attraction. It's just a mall for Pete's sake and even a particularly great one. Edmonton Mall had their run as the world's largest mall once-upon-a-time, with their roller coaster and water park but they are a two trick town. Is either that, the Calgary Stampede or endless fields of wheat. Your pick. We have a bit more history and I would hope more to see than a mall. Since as far as malls go, Eaton's is nothing exceptional. It had the distinction of being the stronghold of the Eaton's empire before it got bought out. Leaving us with next to no Canadian institutions. Seriously, what do we got left? The Bay is long gone, Timmy's is American and we got no mayor beer breweries. Canadian Tire, that's it... and the banks.Alas, if anything this mall is just long. Sure the glass dome over the two buildings lends itself for copious amounts of natural light and might make for a great photo of two. Specially with the flying Geese... What does everyone have a thing for the geese?But the stores in there are no different than anything else you would find at Square One or Yorkdale. I guess it just depends on your budget. For example, my store of choice for regular clothing was the Mexx which has dozens of locations all across town.Sure you can come in a pretty much find almost anything you need, it doesn't mean that you have to come here though. Since they do charge for parking plus, as mentioned before, this place is generally not as busy as it looks since most of the pedestrian traffic is people coming/exiting subway stations. Personally I have not bought anything in this mall in years. However I walked it yesterday and I think I am far, far from the only one."
23,"Eaton Centre is a magnet for people! This place is never busy. Mix of high end and mid end stores, of you're lucky you'll find some bargains.One of the biggest malls in Toronto, so be prepared to walk a long way. Mall is directly connected to Dundas and Queen subway stations, along with 'The Path' (Toronto's subterranean system)."
24,"Imagine Times Square, shrunken down in size a bit and with less people.  That's Toronto Eaton Centre!I loved the live performances and the whole atmosphere of the lights.  My husband and I enjoyed ourselves walking around outside after dinner.  You don't need more than 1 night to enjoy the scenery though.Inside the mall, you'll find many well known brand stores to shop your hearts out.  Sephora, H&M, J Crew, Victoria Secret, Aldo, Forever 21, A&F and etc..."
25,"Big mall, fun to wander. Lots of familiar chain stores. Can get really busy in the evenings (after work) and during the lunch hour. Accessible via the Path, which is great during the winter."
26,"What can I say? It's a mall. Like it or not, if you live in the downtown core you will probably find yourself needing to come here at least once. Eaton is deceptively small - it's a long, single hall flanked by stores, so you don't quite realize that it's three stories tall with a foodcourt that takes up an entire additional basement floor. I think it takes a couple of trips to really appreciate/realize/absorb the size of the mall.What Eaton has in quantity of stores it lacks in size - most of the individual stores are on the smaller side, especially since many of them have a second location on Yonge or Queen West, so Eaton is more about the convenience of having everything in one location. Eaton is definitely very well lit, bright, and airy, with a really nice, massive open skylight and a fountain, which helps mitigate the fact that it is usually extremely crowded and overrun with younger kids and angsty teens. I've pretty much never seen the mall not extremely crowded to some degree.The food court is pretty top notch in terms of quantity - sushi, asian foods, burgers, McDonalds galore, with a massive amount of seating. However, bussiness people tend to swarm here during lunch break, so despite the seating it's still almost impossible to find a table at 12:30.Extremely convenient - right on the PATH, and very easily accessible by public transit."
27,"A ""must do"" in Toronto! There are several floors of shopping tons of food options. My only complaint is the lack of WiFi. Cell coverage works though throughout."
28,"This mall is effing amazing!! I don't consider myself a shopaholic but I love to browse and hang out at malls. This place has everything you could need, a great selection of stores in a beautiful, modern, spacious and bright environment. First thing I noticed was the glass ceiling giving way to a lot of natural sunlight.All the stores all well kept, employees are all extra friendly and willing to help - Despite there being many big chains that I can find back in my hometown, I found something about the people of Toronto - a certain perkiness that I don't notice everywhere.Having everything under one roof makes it convenient but walking from one end to another can be a bit tiring since it's so wide.I'm particularly impressed with the Urban Eatery food court, I love how all restaurants serve food on actual dishware and cutlery and there are no garbage bins as staff sort through the trays to minimize waste. Toronto Eaton Centre immediately set the standard and is ahead of the game, coming from Montreal, the food courts around here only use paper or plastic plates.Only issue is that I found there was a lack of space to sit and rest, food court is always packed.Also, I didn't notice any free wifi available throughout the mall or it's just not advertised, so I assume they don't encourage people to just come and hang out."
29,"An average mall with all the usual stores, quite light and bright and spacious.Nothing special in terms of designer shopping which is disappointing as its the largest mall in Toronto."
30,This place has everything - from the outside you would need to look closely for ways in but once in its huge..! Every type of shop you could want - just lose yourself in shopping...
31,"Eaton is more of a mall for tourists. It's huge and has many brands in one place. Unlike other malls, there's no free parking and it's always super busy. There's lines in almost every store! I prefer shopping online over Eaton.The layout is also kind of weird. There's stairs all over the place (from one level to the same level). Why not just make the entire level flat? There's nothing really high end here, it's more low to middle end. High end brands are all on Bloor."
32,Lol - search indoor shooting range and the eaton center will show up
33,What a great shopping center. It is is multi level mall with lots of great stores. There is a large Nordstrom and many other quality stores.
34,"This place used to be hip, but really, it needs a facelift. Anyway, is a shoppers heaven. I think it has 4 floors. It has a subway stop in the basement for those cold days when you don't want to go outside. Anyway, the last good store here is Roots. And the McDonald's that has been on the upper level forever."
35,"Honestly, not too much of a fan of Eaton Centre for shopping yet, but I feel it is great for other reasons.1. It is a great meeting place. It is connected to Dundas and Queen Station.2. Get a free map of Toronto and downtown Toronto somewhere in this mall.3. Eaton Centre has pretty Christmas displays during Christmas. It is worth waiting for really."
36,"Great place to meet people, sit down, eat, used the free wifi from Apple Store, and window shopping, but never to do regular shopping. It is too expensive."
37,This mall is huge and it has so many levels.  We didn't have a chance to go to all the floors as we were a little bit tired.  We went into couple shops but didn't purchase anythings there.
38,this mall has everything and anything. Quite possibly my favorite mall out towards the east coast of Canada.
39,"Eaton Centre is definitely one of my favourite shopping malls ever! It's accessible via TTC (Dundas Station), located within walking distance of a million restaurants, and also has the perfect selection of stores inside the mall. There's an eclectic mix of high-end/low-end shops as well as the choice between a regular, everyday food court or the fancy one on the other side of the mall. If you're sick of eating mall-food you can walk to any trendy restaurant outside of Eaton. If you're not into shopping, that's okay- you can cross the street to watch a movie if you want!There are huge department stores as well, such as Hudson's Bay and (drumroll please) Saks Fifth Avenue, which is opening soon! If you walk outside a bit you'll reach a smaller mall that contains Muji and Red Lobster. The great thing about Eaton is its proximity to so many delicious restaurants and other attractions. It's a pretty solid tourist choice, but also one of my favourite places to frequent (on a less busy weekday, of course)."
40,"People don't come to Toronto to shop, they leave Toronto to shop.The downtown Eaton Centre has done nothing to change this. The Eaton Centre is mediocre at best and that is giving it more credit then it deserves. You won't find anything original, all the same stores you find in any mall, nothing unique.  If you are fussy about sizes they are not as broad as in the U.S. or other parts of the world.  Everything it taxed multiple times from import tax and duties to HST and on average prices are 30% more than in the U.S.. Seasonal decorations in the mall rarely change year after year and pick pocketing is an acceptable sport.   For some strange reason all this makes the Eaton Centre a tourist attraction. I guess you got to see it to believe it.  If I were to be traveling anywhere in the world a mall would not make my top ten list of sights to see.   I know this sounds negative, not my  intention. Its just the way it is. If you must shop in Toronto, Yorkdale would be the mall of choice. Same stores, nothing special, just cleaner with better service.  The Hudson Bay Company seems to be on track to setting a new standard in Toronto shopping. I hope they keep it up.  Hudson's Bay seem to be nailing selection, presentation and display very well."
41,"Eaton Center is a fairly decent mall in Toronto. It carries all the big names you'd want from a mall; H&M, Gap, Banana Republic, Abercrombie & Fitch, etc. The downtown location is pretty convenient (I hate having to drive out to Yorkdale), and it's a short walk to Queen St. boutiques. My reasoning behind the 'OK' review is because the mall itself sucks; from the hideous Canadian Geese suspended in the air at the Queen St Entrance to the badly planned escalators & elevators. There's so many things that just bother me about this mall that could easily be improved with a little investment. Take the food court for example. It's just plain dirty and poorly laid out. There's only a handful of places to eat and minimal seating. Their solution was to add a second food court and it was a stupid solution. No one ever goes to the second food court because it offers second-rate restaurants. A better idea would have been just to demolish the first food court and use the whole basement level as the food court; It would offer a larger selection of restaurants and provided loads more seating.  Another thing that kills me is the EXTREMELY overpriced parking. $3 each half hour? It takes half an hour just to get the car up the stupid ramp to park! In my opinion it's a mall so parking should be free (or at least less than the $15 maximum charge). The only thing that draws me back to this mall is the store selections, but aside from that the Eatons Center is a dump."
42,"Loved the location, the atmosphere and all the stores !! I need to go back again. I think only thing missing might be the cinema but the regal cinema is close so I went walking  Toronto is such a good place to be!"
43,"The mall was great, but what stole my heart was the outside area of Eaton Centre. Like literally across the street from it.It almost reminds me of Time's Square, but without the overwhelming crowd. We were able to just pulled up some chairs, sip some lemonade and CHILL. (Hell, if I knew about this place ahead of time I probably wouldn't have booked a hotel room in the first place. I would have brought my sleeping gear and camped out!) There's also some pretty cool dancers who come by. When this one girl started playing Thriller, about 30 people came up and we all started getting our zombie boogie on XDThis is one place I'd love to party at for New Year's eve!!!!"
44,"Big, definitely big! As a Vancouverite, who hasn't been to West Edmonton mall, this was a huge mall, multi level! It was well maintained and the washroom were very clean!  It had a lot of shopping choices but I personally didn't find a huge amount of deals. The bottom floor has the Starbucks, if you want a quick recharge!!"
45,TOURIST TRAP TOURIST TRAP.Overcrowded.UncomfortableYou can get exactly the same products at different places.
46,"This is a review specifically of Sketchers. I do a lot of walking so I always get their Go walk shoe. I haven't been to this particular location in ages, and I can safely say I won't be back. This was the worst customer service experience ever. The girl whose name was either Sue or Sam has jumped at me and when I was going to tell her my shoe size she has interrupted me and told me she would measure my feet to be precise. She didn't even tell me what she thought my shoe size was and then when she started bring out shoes I liked the sizes ranged from 8 to 9. Now, my shoe size is 11, so there is a BIG difference between an 8 and an 11 right? When I asked her to bring me a 10 she made a huge scene telling me that it was me who asked her to bring out a 9. She just seemed so confused and it looked like she had no idea what she was doing, randomly bringing out shoes in totally different sizes that I haven't asked her for."
47,"Hi and Good Evening to you all!!.  I have had some horrific experiences in the last six to eight months, and it has been getting progressively worse. I just spoke on the phone with a gentlemen John and, he said that three security guards will be spoken to, and, two females on May 22 were extremely aggressive and, frisked me while I was on my way to drop off a letter to a female in Sunglass Hut whom complained of Harassement, and, it was completely false as it dates back to last Christmas, and, I asked her out for a drink, and, she complained to head office, and, I was given and, told told to leave which I did, and, she went and, revealed my first and, last name as an addict, which she is not allowed and, if no action is taken, then I will. I also focused on the fact that two guys are loitering around the mall seeking attention for money, and, then asking for dates-they need to be warned about this action.  J.P."
48,"Of the last 3 visits to Toronto, I visited the Eaton Centre each time. I really like this mall because it is HUGE! There are just so many stores here, you would never be able to go into all of the stores in one day. Although yes it is just a mall (And a really big one at that... probably the biggest mall I've ever been to) and you could probably shop at another mall and get the same happy feel if you happen to find some wonderful buys, if you haven't already been here, you should come here and see what it's all about. And then after you can see if it was worth the trouble of coming or not."
49,"Eaton centre is a shopping centre in the heart of Toronto. There are the usual chain stores- Zara, H&M, Sears, and a couple of restaurants and a number of fast food chains. There are three levels of shopping. The mall is a bit average- there is nothing exceptional about the mall besides the fact that you're there to go shopping. However, due to its location, it is very convenient, especially since all the major stores are clustered together. The mall is usually packed and busy, even on weekdays. Parking is a bit expensive, but then again it is expensive in downtown Toronto. During boxing day, there are huge sales and it is so busy that you have to line outside the door!"
50,"The biggest mall in Toronto? This place is in the heart of Toronto and downtown. This mall is clean, GINORMOUS, lots of human traffic, and restaurants. It's decorated very nicely with glass doors, skylight ceiling, and great lighting. Food court is located on 1st floor, shops are located on 2nd and 3rd floor. Everything is a bit pricey in terms of food here, not sure how people can afford eating out here. If I didn't have an expense budget, i'd be depressed about food costs. Overall this place is a nice stop if you need to shop, but since i'm not a big shopping fan, it's not really for me. Has your typical American Eagle, Abercrombie, Tiffany's, Kate Spade, Steve Madden, etc. Tips:1) Go to the top floor for the best view"
51,"Das Eaton Centre ist ein konventionelles Einkaufszentrum, mit einem Abercrombie & Fitch Laden. Meines Wissens einer der wenigen in Kanada."
52,"5 stars if you are using it as a hub to visit other sites in the area as well.The Queen (NOT Queen Park) subway station exit leads right into the mall, so convenient! A welcomed sight is a Starbucks and Mrs. Field's cookies close to the exit: coffee and fresh baked cookies yummmmm! My friend an I sat by the fountain nearby to enjoy our goodies.The Eaton Centre boasts ""250+ best-in-class retailers, restaurants and services"". I'm a hardcore thrifter, so I don't shop at malls. However, this is a great place to people watch,  see what's fashionable and trendy, get home decorating ideas, take tons of fun pictures against beautiful and sometimes quirky shop windows, and of course, to eat.It was Saurday around noon and the place wasn't crowded at all. We leisurely strolled around the mall, walked through the sky bridge, crossed the street to check out Cloud Gardens (note to self, come back during the week when the conservatory is open), came back for a lovely lunch at LeÃ±a, walked around the mall's perimeter to admire some of the surrounding architecture, then stopped by Yonge-Dundas Square, all before heading home.My friend and I had a great time. I wouldn't mind coming back again."
53,My client & I did some eating and shopping today!
54,"Certainly not my favourite mall in Toronto, but it's always crucial to bring relatives here who are touring the city. Eaton Centre is more of a landmark than a mall, with Dundas Square always hosting activities, this mall is always packed as in uncomfortably packed where you'd have to be mindful not to walk into anyone. The interior isn't very spacious, and the roofs are very low making the space seem even more constricted. The parking lot is also a pain to get in and out of - one lane exiting out into Yonge Street with pedestrians constantly in your way on top of having to wait for the traffic light causes a huge line up of cars waiting to leave. The stores inside Eaton Centre are the same as any other mall, except for Stuart Weitzman. I'm very impressed by the improved food court - lots of seating with a modern/chic design. Anyways, if I could avoid coming to this mall, I would."
55,Great mall! Has low to high end stores and everything you need! I love the new Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue-adds a bit of flair to the downtown core.
56,"It's fashionable to hate on the Eaton Centre, to poo poo it. Yeah, it's the Disney of retail. And many want to lay all kinds of problems with Yonge street retail because of it. But I have a hard time imagining I'd go downtown without the Eaton Centre there.The addition of the Best Buy and Canadian Tire to the ass end were pretty brilliant moves. The Canadian Tire at the Eaton Centre, unfortunately, is the worst Canadian Tire I've ever used in the nearly 44 years I've been alive.Sears as the new anchor really doesn't cut it in terms of high end retail. I seem to recall the Eaton Centre having more fashion shows and the like. Now it seems the public spaces have been given over to product promotions. Some are comical enough, like a bevy of young women in bathrobes handing out free liquid soap. I'll take 6.The food courts are dark and dingy and really in need of renovation. I never eat there.Hmmm. Yeah, this is technically a four star review. What do I like about it? The Old Navy is my go to place for clothing. It's dead easy to get to. It's a focus for some many odd ball types. People watching is great. It's a good launching point to hit Queen street, the water front, etc. The Second Cup kiosk on the north end always has my favorite brews ready and hot."
57,"This mall does the deed: you can buy clothes, shoes, electronics, housewares and even toiletries. The food court has sufficient variety to satisfy junk food craving and to keep you honest on your diet.There isn't a particular store located here that I cannot find in another mall in the city or on the high street. The actual Eaton's store closed long before I arrived to the city, with a Sears taking over its location, which as I write this, is closing down its operations in Canada! There is an office tower adjacent and if you worked there, this mall would be your salvation and your fall. Just saying.Unfortunately, you sometimes get caught in the crossfire of gun fights....Just be aware."
58,Some parts of the mall are renovated and other parts are ghetto. They need a major renovation and make it up to par with Yorkdale Mall or Sherway Gardens.
59,"I like going there and just browsing the plethora of stores.  I go there about one a month to find a gem I like be it clothing or a toy or gadget for my niece and nephews. I always treat myself to fast food at the end of my shopping adventure and my feet are usually exhausted by the end.  My only thing is that it is super busy all year round,  so if you are going there to relax it might not be the option for you unless, you find a busy mall relaxing."
60,Toronto Eaton Centre is a huge shopping mall well located in downtown. It has so many different shops for every taste and budget. We appreciated the interior decoration and spent few hours there. We could rest while enjoying some good food. The atmosphere is friendly and everybody is trying to find suitable offers. The service is very friendly and there are different prices.
61,"This is probably the most magnificent mall I have been too in the whole Canada! This is also the biggest mall in Toronto too! This mall also has high-end stores like Lucky Brand, Tiffany & Co, LUSH, Kate Spade, Harry Rosen, LuluLemon, Apple Store, & MUJi. A great dining selection can be found here, with Starbucks, Tim Hortons, Sbarro, Trinity Square Cafe, Urban Eatery, Dairy Queen, Mc'Donald's, & Bannok! This is one of the best malls in the world!"
62,"Don't be fooled by reviews stating this is the ""biggest mall in Canada"" as it is not.....in fact I'm not even sure it's the biggest mall in Toronto. The Eaton Centre was part of the urban renewal of downtown Toronto and is a hit and miss in its efforts.While not the biggest mall....it is fairly large......stores on three levels that are connected to both the subway and PATH (Toronto's huge subterranean system). Anchored by Queen St to the south and Dundas St to the north, it runs a full city block. Just across Queen St (to the South) is the Bay.....with its iconic window displays at Christmas...not to be missed. During peak hours (Monday - Friday -  11:00am - 2:00pm) it is busy with local workers shopping for deals. It can get very crowded and the food court line ups ridiculously long. Ditto for after work (4:30pm - 7pm). After that is quiets down. Avoid at all costs on Boxing Day and any day that there's a parade downtown or an event at Nathan Phillips Square. Its a magnet for people on those days.One big bonus is that you can shop downtown on a rainy day and not get wet, or not wear a coat during a cold winter snap....."
63,"First of the ""The Guys SURVIVAL Guide to Malls"" series is the almighty Toronto Eaton Centre -In. To. You.-Brief Intro:4 levels(Concourse, 1, 2, 3) of retail shops and services conveniently situated between Dundas and Queen subway station along Yonge street.  Top level(4) accomodates paid parking and and as this is a TOURIST attraction, it is open pretty much all year round including Statutory Holidays.Guest Services centrally located but I've noticed recently there are small standing booths through-out were the Guest Service staff cannot seat but stand and walk around looking for lost faces to ASSIST.  It's a big mall therefore closer to the Food spots you'll notice fully loaded garbage cans.  Great open skylight roof for natural light source.Seating Comfort Level:(***--)I give Eaton's an A-OK as it is comfortably cushioned however monochrome uninspiring seating that look the same everywhere.  Most do not have backs to the seats so it's simply provided as an afterthought.  Guys sitting for 15+ minutes while waiting for their significant other will begin to suffer.Safety Zone:(***--)Level 2 is the Safety Zone of choice because it's the Men's level for SEARS as well as it is better than Classy Bling Level 3(Coach, Michael Kors, Ecco, Sephora, Birks, La Swiss, Banana Republic, bebe,etc...) and Youth with Credit Cards Level 1(Hollister, MAC, La Senza, AE, etc...)  Level 2 is not perfect by any means but Swarovski($100+) is 10x better than Birks($1,000+) however beware of the soon to be open Victoria's Secret where you'll have to SHARE seats with guys waiting at the A&F.Exit Strategy:(****-)Centre Court Fountain otherwise known in the Al Bundy world as Fountain of Dispair where the women leave their guys with empty wallets to sit in dispair.  If you are within the vicinity of this Fountain then you are at the spot.  Level 2 is PRIME real estate as it allows you to exit from all directions as well as go up and down levels.  It is also street level for that perfect escape.Entertainment Level:(*----)While waiting for others and watching other patrons zoom past you in the walkway there are very little that can help you keep your mind away from the fact that you're waiting there looking PATHETIC.  Prepare your own entertainment or sneak over to one of the following: Apple, Indigo Books, EB Games, HMV, Sony Style, Black's, Great American Back Rub."
64,"Big, modern, tons of stores - including an apple store, and the amazing urban eatery. No movie theatre and directory is sometimes confusing."
65,??????????????????1-3?????????????????????the bay??????????????????????????????????????????????????????nordstorm??????????????????????????????????????~
66,"This place has everything!!! I was Super excited to come here! I loved all the stores and the food court is awesome! They had alot of cool shops inside they have a disney store a store for teas, a hot topic, a luggage store, shoe stores, huge department stores and a hot topic! We didn't get through all the stores we were only there for a few hours but we had fun downtown and at the mall"
67,"The Eaton Centre is a big attraction in Toronto, and I can understand why. Usually one of the first malls to get new stores (Sephora, Bath and Body Works, Hollister, etc), convenient location with 2 Subway stops, great place to bring tourists, etc. If you are going to actually shop with something in mind, it is hellish. This mall has its fair share of slow-walkers and even those who decide to have a conversation, stopping and standing at the top/bottom of escalators. It is a true ""hang-out"" for teenagers, and while I am trying to not sound like an old curmudgeon, they usually irritate me.There are 2 very useless food courts. I say useless, because there is rarely any seating, the selection of fast food isn't that great, and they are both at basement-level. Not well lit, noisy, and really - what is up with the 2 food courts? I can see how it would be a good idea, but sometimes I want to get something from food court #1, while my shopping partner was hoping to get something from food court #2. They should've just made a big, central one. My other gripe with the Eaton Centre is the double-stores. There are some stores with 2 Eaton Centre locations. Really, the mall is not THAT large, I don't see the point. I hate when I am, say, shoe shopping and I'm in Aldo thinking ""I swear I've already seen all these shoes..."" and then I remember I have, at the other Aldo, at the other end of the mall. I guess this is me just being really picky, now. Anyways - I will continue to go here from time to time, because there are some newer stores and my friends/family will always drag me out here. Though I wouldn't suggest doing any actual Christmas shopping here, it is a great mall to visit around that time of year. The tree is beautiful and their Santa set-up can't be beat!"
68,i feel like this mall has any store you could ever want been here a few times in my life and everyone always loves coming here but just as any shopping center anywhere you don't want to spend a whole day here
69,"Toronto Eaton Centre is more like a tourist attraction than where local people will shop...(unless everything else are closed during statuary holidays) Of course unless you live downtown.. doesn't really worth a drive down and pay for parking and everything. Eaton Centre just another faceless, unforgettable Mall just like all those up at the Suburbs. Eaton Centre though has a lot of foot traffic from the Dundas subway station and people walking through The PATH. If you want to spend a leisure afternoon window shopping. this is not the place. Feels like people are all racing off to somewhere and will definitely run you over it they need to. If you lucky enough to have out of towner visiting, I guess you have to bring them to Eaton Centre for a photo or 2.."
70,"I came here to get some shopping done and I was quite impressed. This mall is huge and has every store you can think of. I was so happy with the variety of stores and the amount of parking. However the parking is quite pricy! We paid $24 for like 6 hours. Better to take train to be honest! However, the staff in all the stores we visited we so sweet and made our experience memorable. I highly recommend this mall! It is huge and has everything you need."
71,"Simply... its a mall. I'm sorry if I'm not too thrilled but when I go to another place I want to go to stores that we don't have here in the states. I'm not trying to visit Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, J crew, Disney, Teavanna etc. We have all those here at Somerset Collection. Sorry I just needed to vent. Ok back on track now.... I was happy to go to Le Chateau, Zara and RW & Co but they really don't have many kid stores and that's what they lack, the only kids store was Disney - If you're a tourist and you must go, go, but I've been once and don't see the need to make it a reoccurring visit. (OK I'm done) Oh by the way the food court (urban eatery) was nice!"
72,"Well, who doesn't like Eaton Centre? I sure do!We did Toronto for Thanksgiving 2017 and we had the obligatory visit to Eaton Centre for some shopping --specifically at Roots, and with the convenient exchange rate, this was a must for our visit.We had a quick bite for breakfast (food court is not life-changing, I should say) and then went on shopping. Roots was our first stop and they were having this massive sale. Got some things there. Then TNA, some sports store, and a couple of other things here and there.Place is clean, modern, well-lit, seasonally decorated, wide open spaces.Will I come back if I ever make it back to Toronto? Sure."
73,"Let me sum it up in one word - bleck.I would rather shop anywhere else with the exception of the Scarborough Town Centre which is the most detestable.Teeming with mannerless people, this place is loud, inhospitable, and always hotter than hell.If I really needed to go to the mall to buy something, maybe it's time to reconsider that item.  There are SO many wonderful places to shop elsewhere in this city that I can safely avoid suffering there.  Leave it to the twin ts - teens and tourists."
74,"I honestly can't stand this mall. I would recommend you avoid it whenever possible unless your idea of a good time is dealing with tourists so slow you'll feel like your standing still and teenagers that block your way. The stores here are actually really great, there's a huge variety of places for every person and budget but if possible I would recommend going to yorkdale which has pretty much the same places as the eaton centre if possible. There's nothing wrong with the actual mall itself but the people who go here can really get on your nerves I can't tell you how many times I've had someone stop in front of me just to look around. If the slow walkers doesn't bother you though then you'll definitely enjoy coming here much more then I do.Overall the mall is great there's a wide selection of stores and I'd give it 4 stars if it weren't for the people which sadly ruin this place for me but definitely check it out and hopefully you'll have a better shopping experience here then I did."
75,"This is a huge mall which houses a lot of shops but all of them are chains. The mall itself spans an entire city block and even has a church connected to it! There are a number of shops on several levels including a Kernels, Gap, Sears, Aldo, a florist, and tons more. The mall can be accessed through two subway stops  Dundas and Queen. If you exit at Dundas then there is the possibility of also going to the mall next door so be careful to exit to the Eatons centre."
76,Turn down the heat!  Why is every mall in Canada so hot inside.  It's boiling in here and freezing outside.  I have to take off my gear and lug it around when I'm trying to spend money. Turn down the heat!!
77,"It's a little disappointing that being one of the biggest malls located in the heart of Toronto lacks a variety of stores in comparison to those that are just a bit outside of the downtown core. I find that Yorkdale Mall for example in comparison to the Toronto Eaton Centre offers so much more variety of stores that ranges from average pricing to luxurious brands such as Gucci, Prada, etc. within one mall. I feel that The Toronto Eaton Centre definitely needs to add new stores, perhaps expand in some way to drive more volume into consumers actually purchasing goods. Although the shopping isn't fantastic there, the somewhat recent renovation of their food court is amazing! Offering different types of fast food and even healthy alternatives!"
78,very busy shopping area with loads of variety
79,"Plenty of stores have come and gone (including Eaton's itself), but this mall remains a mainstay for shoppers, especially downtown. The location is probably one of its biggest assets, located right by Yonge-Dundas Square and accessible from two TTC stations. The Urban Eatery, the mall's food court, is definitely one of the highlights - upmarket food offerings served with real dishes and silverware. Richtree still remains too. Recent renovations have also done a decent job at modernizing the mall, and the glass roof lets in plenty of sunlight. Unfortunately, some of the lower levels feel a bit more cramped, with lower ceilings. The mall also gets pretty stuffy especially when it's crowded. Huge variety of stores, as the mall essentially takes up a whole city block. Sears and Hudson's Bay right across the street serve as anchors, while other favorites like Apple, Lacoste, H&M, A&F, Hollister, Victoria's Secret, Coach, Indigo, etc. round out the rest. However, there is a conspicuous lack of higher-end shopping at Eaton's; if you're looking for designer stores, then head north for Yorkville/Bloor St. No free Wi-fi unfortunately, but parking rates are reasonable if you can find a spot. If you live nearby or work downtown then the Eaton Center can be convenient, but to be honest I'd prefer shopping at Yorkdale for a less hectic experience."
80,"Lots of stores, even more people. . .expensive and stressful.  Maybe I'm just not a mall person."
81,Such a huge mall! You'll most likely find something here if you forgot to pack something or if you just want to go (window) shopping. This place was packed with so much people in the late afternoon. Not sure if this is how it normally is or if half of the people there are tourists. It was nice to visit and see what kind of stores Toronto had to offer. We enjoyed the Roots store but it was a bit on the pricey side. This mall is central to a lot of places and was easily walkable from our hotel.
82,So this place is HUGE!!!! Has probably ever store known to man in this place!!!! from Zara to some To brands!!! Great place to spend an afternoon in TO!!! Modernly designed..spacious...but packed full of people!!! If you go on a Saturday its like a mob scene...but if you're in TO you have to head over here!
83,I enjoy this Mall even though it's so crowded ! It has a warm welcoming atmosphere and a great selection of stores. I find the staff friendly even the security guard who I bothered to help direct me to a Starbucks haha It's also very clean and has seating areas. Also plenty of garbage and recycling which is good. I also saw the Christmas tree and reindeer decor. So beautiful!
84,"Don't like this place even though it's the only mall downtown.  Lots of shops and the only Massimo Dutti around.Is it worth the trade off?  A lot of people here are shady and just like to loiter.  Apparently it's a hot spot for pickpockets and thieves.Beware of a small group of girls who approach you.  One will engage, then the other will distract.  When you get distracted, the one who engaged will steal whatever it is they want from you.Spotted 10/6/13 in the food court trying to steal a purse from the daughter of an old man in the food court. Two girls, of European ethnic-descent."
85,"Unfortunately, I've been dragged through various malls.  Some have suprised me and others are lackluster.  Toronto Eaton Centre is the latter.  The only stores that I have any use for are the Apple Store, Aveda, and Crabtree & Evelyn.   Most of the time, the mall is bombarded with people that pass through the mall.  People walk from Queen Street to get to Dundas Street and vice-versa.  The layout is outdated and there is nothing remotely interesting about the stores in this mall.  I hope that they build a Westfield Mall here soon!"
86,"I'm weird. When I go to other cities I love going to their malls. It's just something I do. I like to see what's the same, what's different, and what the stores that are the same are selling that's different.The Eaton Centre is amazing. A shopper's delight. Also, a time killer's delight too. It's enormous here! The Centre has three full stories of shops and eateries. Literally a shop for every type of person.Their cafeteria or food court had a lot of options. Everything was very clean. I like that they weren't standard fold court chain restaurants. I did notice how busy it was but then remembered that this mall is right in the middle of the business area.The restrooms are clean which is a big plus. Free wifi which was amazing for someone who was relying on wifi heavily during my trip.The location is perfect. It's a great spot to meet people, again, especially if you're out of town. I met most of my friends here as it was the easiest place for me to navigate to before heading on to our adventures.You can also access the PATH from the Eaton Centre so you don't ever have to go outside! What more do you need?"
87,Toronto Eaton centre is an amazing mall. It has something for everyone from mid to high end pricing. Christmas isn't quite the same without a visit to this mall with all the beautiful decorations on every floor. Across the street on Queen Street the Bat windows are decorated with all their moving characters. People line up to take pictures. It is truly a family day out. Shopping is amazing and those eggnog lattes just warm your heart.
88,"I'm convinced that the Eaton Centre is the modern incarnation of Dante's ""Inferno"". As in, it is hell. Pure hell.Believe you me, I love a good shopping mall as much as the next gal, but I avoid the Eaton Centre like the plague. Oh Eaton Centre, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways:1) Teeming with truant teenagers and tired tourists, travelling through the mall itself is a true testament to tenacity. The layout of the centre is confusing, and combined with the constant crowds, navigation can be complicated and challenging (cue applause). 2) It is said that ""variety is the spice of life."" Consider that the Eaton Centre has 3 Aldos, 2 Bell Worlds, 2 Feet Firsts, 2 Nutrition Houses, and 2 Sunglass Huts, to name a few. Is this really necessary? Is it a secret ploy by the city of Toronto to encourage everyone to be getting proper nutrition while rocking fabulous footwear, sporting sunglasses and chatting on a cell phone? 3) The one redeeming quality of the Eaton Centre - the prime, central location - is also, in several ways, its downfall. Parking is expensive. Hordes of people travelling to and from Dundas and Queen stations and the PATH converge here. Trying to hunt for deals isn't easy when battling major pedestrian traffic.  4) The washrooms - if you can find one, that is - are always in high demand. High demand washrooms equate to dutty, dutty washrooms.For decent mall shopping, Yorkdale is just a hop and a skip away by subway, and is far less congested with pretty much the same (if not better) selection of stores."
89,"The shittiest mall/service I've ever encountered in my life.The bathrooms were nasty -- I found myself longing for the latrines on Indian trains. I'm not even joking. Don't actually expect service inside the stores. I did not get greeted in any store that I perused. I actually tried to make eye contact with personnel and they just stared back, blankly. This was in 99.9% of the stores I visited. I only got greeted in one - French Connection. I don't even shop there, but just went because my husband wanted to. There's also really nothing special about this mall. It's just a mall. It's not like NYC where they may actually stock different items. It's just regular. I'm confused as to why they regard this as a tourist destination. Save your time and money and just shop at home, wherever that is."
90,"a pretty mall with high vaulted glass ceilings. Fun to look at, but the size of the place is daunting if you're just there to waste some time. I don't understand why there are more than one of the same store here, it gives me the feeling of ground hog day. wasn't i just here?i like shopping but i wasn't into this place. i checked out the H&M next door and was happier there. right across the street from Younge-Dundas Square so convenient to touristy stuff."
91,"Das Eaton Centre ist ein mehrstÃ¶ckiges Einkaufszentrum in der City von Toronto. Das Eaton Centre beherbergt auf 3 Etagen Ã¼ber 300 GeschÃ¤fte, Boutiquen und Restaurants.In der Mitte wird das Eaton Centre mit einer Glaskuppel nach MailÃ¤nder Vorbild Ã¼berdacht.

Das Eaton Centre ist bequem mit der U-Bahn zu erreichen."
92,It is a beautiful mall with lots of stores in it. Especially Indigo is the main attraction for me.
93,"Whenever I'm in Toronto, my family brings me here. It's a mall. They've got LUSH, Best Buy, Disney Store, Lacoste, Old Navy, Swarovski, Teavana, Coach, etc. They have about nine restaurants in here. Their food court has a nice selection of options. The mall is well kept. Each store has a nice window display. Everything's neat and organized. Employees are helpful and friendly. I wouldn't say this is my favorite place to visit when I'm in Toronto. It's a bit too touristy for me. It's a nice place to visit though, at least once."
94,"I was in Toronto for a work trip and this was my spot! I think I walked over here every night just to enjoy the views and the Christmas ambiance. This small is so pretty and decorated very nicely during he holiday.When you first get there you notice one thing while your standing outside. It looks familiar. Then you realize OH it looks just like NY, but a smaller version. The mall has three stories. They have Nordstrom for all you boujee folks out there LOL They did have sales but shoots, I'm like clearance on top of another clearance is what they need for me to buy anything  They had some local spots if you were looking for Canadian made clothing. I can't recall the name of the brand but they had quality warm stuff OH and Lululemon for my workout sisters! They had a huge sale rack too so I was all over that. They had tons of other stores to choose from. OH there was a bookstore! I was so happy to see a bookstore. You don't see those in Vegas anymore. It's rare."
95,Big and massive in downtown.  Can't really complain with the location and types of stores offered.  Gets a little crowded but expected with such a good location.The mall also gives you a chance to cut through indoors while going from Queen to Dundas.
96,"Now Eaton is a place I love to visit, great for tourists and 6ixers alike. It's also fairly priced (store wise) and if you can't find something to eat inside, you can just walk out to the square and find a place out on the street (not that Eaton doesn't have a wide variety of restaurants in their food court). The stores are great clothing wise. They even have a floor dedicated to expensive wear. It's a must go, must visit and must experience."
97,"Christmas is always fun at the Eaton Centre with amazing holiday displays, this year being the huge red Christmas tree and the animals. This place has a good amount of escalators for your tired feet, as you easily walk for miles in here. Make sure you wear sneakers for your day of shopping. The selection of stores is outstanding such as Coach, Roots, Apple, etc.  and I love how it's easy to go back to stores on another level. High end stores are at the top. The food courts still aren't the greatest to me and super noisy. That's the only downside."
98,"While I was only there for a few hours on a trip to Toronto, I was pretty impressed with the selection of stores they had. With it being in downtown, it was busy on a Sunday afternoon. Make that SUPERRR busy, to the point where I felt a little overwhelmed. I've never seen a mall so packed! For a second, I thought it was Christmas around the corner.But aside from the busy factor, the mall was clean, huge, and above average compare to other malls around. Can't remember if there were any upscale stores but they do have your average H&M, Forever 21, etc. And who can complain to that, nice clothes that doesn't cause a hole in your pocket?"
99,"Busy mall...i mean VERY BUSY MALL.Usually out of my size in everything.Guarantee to say excuse me, at least five times...or just push through.Many stores (+star).Personally, I hardly choose to come here. Walk along Queen Street West instead!Or go to another mall that isn't as crazy as this one...which is hard to find in the GTA area."
100,Sehr sehr sehr grÃ¶ÃŸtes Kaufhaus als in Deutschland.. Mit vielen Weihnachtsschmuck schÃ¶Ã¶n
101,"It was a good experience driving from NY to Toronto. This place is like Time Square of NYC, so it is great place for tourist. However, some of the streets/road were busy around those area due to construction work. Eaton's Centre, great place to get your photo taken, the mall is HUGE, but i did heard about complains about their services. It's close by chinatown (small), decent parking spots (some parking service will rip you off if you're not from Canada, they look at your license plate first... mine was from CA).There were so much things to do in one day, so I didn't stay here all day. I will come back someday to check this place out again."
102,"Lots of shops. Place is huge.But not sitting anywhere outside shops.Only ONE elevator working in the mall of thousands for people with strollers and infants like us. RIDICULOUS !! Three elevators, one for going up and down to floors 1-3, the other two for going up/down to parking levels. The line up was huge with other families with strollers. We waited 20+ minutes and could never get on, so we took the stairs.NOT A FAMILY FRIENDLY MALLI grew up in Toronto, and love the Eaton Centre for what it is and provides downtown. But, this was not an enjoyable experience. If the Loblaws located in the old Mapleleaf Gardens can do things right so can the Eaton Centre.2 stars until next time"
103,"Wow, this place is huge.  You can shop until you drop or just walk around and people watch.  It is difficult to navigate, and so it's not the best place to go if you're in a time crunch.  However, it pretty much has everything you might need from low-end to high-end."
104,"PREAMBLE: The Eaton Centre is a good, standard mall - airy, spacious, with your usual mall shops.  The food courts are very average.  However, I've taken many clients shopping here.  The biggest blemish on an otherwise good mall is the Ladies bathroom just inside the Queen Street entrance, behind Bebe.BATHROOM RANT: THIS BATHROOM IS A FREAKING NIGHTMARE, PISS ME OFF!  Scuze the pun.  This bathroom has the WORST FENG SHUI OF ANY BATHROOM IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.  Why, oh WHY, when architects design women's washrooms, do they NOT CONSULT WOMEN???  Because it's obvious they don't.When you approach, there is ALWAYS a line-up out the door.  Why don't they double the stalls in women's washrooms?  When you are waiting, you have to lean on the heavy door to prop it open.  While you wait, your eardrums are blown out because they installed these handryers that will seriously knock you to the back wall if you don't take a strong stance.  Gotta love the no-paper-towels-let's-save-the-environment thang, but do I have to lose my hearing in my left ear?  The stalls may be average size, but there's one thing the moronic bathroom designers neglected to consider: WE ARE SHOPPING.  WE HAVE BAGS OF STUFF.  So of course, you have to wedge yourself in and you must suck in to shut the friggin' door.  Typically, there is nowhere to hang up your stuff.  Sigh.On your way out, you MUST bump into people.  There is no other way.  My favourite part is washing your hands.  THERE IS NO COUNTER SPACE TO PUT YOUR PURSE AND BAGS.  Sigh.  So you have to dump your bags on the floor, awkwardly wedge your purse between your legs, and awkwardly wash your hands.  It's starting to look like a Mr. Bean skit, people.Then you have to turn on those god-awful hand dryers which will blow you to the back wall (you will have the wind-tunnel face lift after) whilst taking out the left ear drum of a person in line.  Then you have to bump into people on your way out.  What should take a few minutes becomes an epic tale of Tolstoy proportions.WHY didn't the bathroom designer think of airport bathrooms??  They have wide open spaces, no door, and they're roomy for passengers schlepping luggage.  And to think, this bathroom was renovated - !!!!  AAArrgh.Whoever designed this bathroom should be shot.Thank you; I feel sooOOoo much better.  (Liz exhales)"
105,"The only free Wifi spots I've had luck with (not including coffee shops) is the Apple Store and Druxy's (downstairs, South end).  You can sit in the food court from as far as the escalators.This mall is pretty much the flagship of all the stores in Toronto.  Even the Victoria's Secret angels opened the new shop.Hectic like a madman on weekends but great vibe for locals and tourists.  Even current renovations have been carefully crafted to make still look aesthetically pleasing."
106,"Food: 4/5Service: n/a (vary b/t stores)Cleanliness: 5/5Decor & Setup: 5/5LOVE THIS MALL.  its probably one of my favorite malls in N. America. Of course it has pretty much every store you can think of.It also connects to PATH (Toronto's underground shopping and business area).  Not very many underground places in the States.Many restaurants are connected in PATH also.I love how the train connects right to the mall so I don't have to drive or park anywhere. Can get  a lil too crowded sometimes.IMO, it out ranks Houston Galleria, Dallas galleria, and Glendale Galleria.  Well, i guess I havent been to many big malls in N. America lol.  Maybe thats why I like the Eaton Centre so much.Overall the mall is very clean and a nice scenery part of downtown."
107,"Pros: Simple mall layout, easy to find everything you need; 3 Starbucks so that is awesome for you starbucks lovers. The chapters is beautiful, some nice stores in the mall and pretty good sales from time to time. Right downtown so you can be apart of all the action. Lots of food to choose from in food court. Lots of restaurants near the eaton center too. Close to several subway stops.Cons: Dirty washrooms (The sinks have built up scum on the back splash), Apple store has the worst cx service... tried buying a brand new Mac pro with cash and it took 45 minutes on a Wednesday. Food court is too noisy and busyOverall, lots of amazing memories at The Eaton Centre. Also to anyone who reads this, you should look up the T. Eaton Co. Limited. The malls name carries with it some very interesting HISTORY  ! :)"
108,I love the Eatons Centre because it keeps expanding. Brand new stores like Michael Kors and Victoria's Secret- coming soon!! Great mall to shop for shoes! Big food court. And it's attached to The Hudson's Bay Company which is 8 floors high! Amazing store..
109,"The Toronto Eaton Centre is a huge, huge mall - I have been shopping several times at the Eaton Centre.   There are two food courts in the mall so plenty to choose from.   Also there is an Apple Store and a Microsoft store - so you have both covered.   Also a best buy and Canadian Tire for everyday electronics and stuff.  It is very difficult to find stores in the mall - so if you need something check online before going to the mall as it is confusing to find stores."
110,The Eaton Centre has a great selection of stores with good variety - you have some upper-end stores as well as more affordable ones. The food court also has lots of different options for anything you might be in the mood for. And I love the big Indigo store here!!
111,"Location location location. Very convenient to say the least about this mall. Organized floor levels by how expensive the shops are lowest to highest . Always very busy and packed. New food court is delicious and very cheap price wize and has a lot of good items , my fave is the szewhan for sure. And even a aroma which is one of the better coffee chains for sure. The con of this mall is that it has a lot of traffic ALWAYS being such a tourist magnet it's pretty hectic. I do like how it's connected w two of the major subways (dundas and queen along w their streetcara so if needing a warm sheltered way to walk to either this is usually the better option."
112,This is just a huge mall. Nothing special at all. Typical name brands. Clean and spacious. Maybe somewhere to go when it's raining out and you don't want to be at home. There's not many kids related stores. Mostly targeted to men and women clothing.
113,"This was a cool and fun downtown mall, conveniently located in the city center.  There were some great clothing options and it's anchored by The Bay department store.  The food options seemed to fall a bit short of what I would expect for a mall like this, but everything else was very good."
114,One of toronto's busiest malls. It has a lot of different stores from Nike to apple. There is underground parking but it's expensive. It's easily accessible as it's on the subway line. Bad idea to come here during the holidays as it becomes really packed. Besides shopping there is a renovated food court with anything you can want. There are also some great restaurants like joeys.
115,"This mall was across the street from our hotel damn smack in the middle of Downtown Toronto. its huuuuge. i mean some parts are underground, and the mall is connected to the subway station. but about a whole city block of MALL. Th food court is the Bizzz, feels like a modern Japanese restaurant on a baseball field scale. Eat NY Fries... trust me!I came here on a mini vacay and was not bored. Enjoy... make sure you have comfy walking shoes on, and SHOP AWAY!!!!"
116,"One of my favorite places to be in the GTA!  EC has tons of shops spread out over three floors for all tastes and styles.  A well represented food court for that quick bite to eat.  Convenient location to other major attractions in TO.  I would agree with others suggestions when taking the subway and use Queens, but hell I have made the walk from the Hockey Hall of Fame on a nice day!  Overall this center is clean and full of excitement!  If your in the GTA make it a point to stop by."
117,"Celebrate for Christmas!!!  I went to Eaton Centre yesterday and was so excited with the decoration there! Wowo so cuteeeee. Outside and inside Eaton they decorate all. I dont know they will do more something or not. People walk around here a lot and almost they stop here and take some pics, ofcourse me too :))). I like the polar bear the most, so cute and didnt know that they can dance haha. I feel warmer when I see them, less lonely a little bit. Everyone hurry up to prepare and waiting for special moments of the end of year, and also for new year. This is my second winter here in Canada, kind of sad and sometime want to give up here but Canadian give me more motivation to know that, here is cold just outside, but warm inside. Who is international student like me here, I hope u can see this review, and will feel better in this cold winter, cheeres!!!"
118,"I think this mall serves its purpose in terms of luring tourists in and forcing them to shop till they drop. However, as a Toronto (well, GTA) native, I don't ""love"" this mall.I do, however, like the mall for its variety of stores (Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, Armani Exchange, to name a few), as well as having one of the best food courts I've ever seen in a mall (Urban Eatery). Outside all that pizzazz, however, it's just another mall that only happens to get the amount of tourists just because it's in downtown. Other malls (or independent stores) closer to where I live serve the same purpose, so the only way I would visit the Eaton Centre is if I do a downtown trip (which, unfortunately, hasn't been as often as a couple of years back). Oh, and it closes too early for a tourist mall.The subway connection signs are noted clearly as well, so tourists won't get lost."
119,"The Eaton Centre is a circus!Lots of stores, but sometimes the crowds here are just too much for me.Aside from that - why does the Eaton Centre close early on Saturdays? Many smaller malls in the GTA are open until 9pm on Saturdays.  The Eaton Centre closes at 7pm.  It doesn't make sense to me.  If they stayed open until 9, they'd be packed for those 2 hours.. and it would be more convenient.I like that there are other stores nearby, on Yonge Street, if the Eaton Centre itself doesn't have what you need."
120,"This place is overwhelming, to say the least, and home to your standard mall fare (generic name brands, mid-range labels and more affordable consorts). Conveniently located at the centre of downtown Toronto, it's a good place to congregate, meet with friends and sate any desire for retail therapy. If it's relaxation you're desperately in need for, this isn't the place to go. Crowded, cacophonic and big, Eaton Centre is disorienting even at the best of times."
121,"Das Eaton Centre ist ein riesiges Einkaufszentrum, wo man sich theoretisch ca eine Woche aufhalten kann, bis man alles gesehen hat. Man kann so ziemlich alles bekommen, vor allem Klamotten, unten im Keller ist ein food court, hier kann man international essen: italienisch, griechisch, asiatisch was das Herz begehrt"
122,Love mostly all Zara stores including this one. They are always nice no matter how busy the store is and matter how many items you're returning. This includes their managers/signers. They are always very patient and friendly!
123,"This mall is huuuge! Finding what you are looking for here is quite challenging even if you use Google maps (yes, you can use Google maps inside this mall. Great selection of shops that should keep you busy.If you are hungry then head to their amazing food court. I recommend urban herbivore.Overall a great mall, clean, free WiFi. Good for shopping, eating, and for Ryerson students to meet up!"
124,"Sure, it's a massive shopping centre, filled with tourists and teenagers and the same old stores you'll find in any other mall, but it's THE downtown mall, meaning one cannot help but be sucked into it from time to time (if not just to avoid walking outside in a snow storm whilst trying to get from Dundas to Queen). What I like about it right now is the CRAZY big Christmas tree covered in 10,000 Svarovski crystals! It's up until December 31st, right in the middle of the mall, but really? You can't miss it. It's so sparkly and pretty, plus it turns at a very slow pace, hypnotizing you with its glittery-giganticism......................must.......buy.........crystals? Yes.............crystals.................."
125,Fancy place to be in the heart of the city. I've seen so many changes within this place since it opened (I've been in the GTA for 43 years now) and I think the only thing which has remained since day one is the very popular water fountain.
126,The Eaton Centre serves as the premiere mall in downtown Toronto. One must appreciate the open expanse of the mall and the clean upscale feel! It has your typical mall shops (over two hundred of them) plus a solid food court. The traffic volume through here is probably the most for a mall in Canada. One thing quite humorous that I noticed in December was a big panel of TV screens with a fire scene sizzling in the background! I once saw this in a hotel room in Edmonton and I laughed but at the Eatons centre? Lol!This mall defines the mall experience it is a crowning jewel in the Cadillac Fairview portfolio.  A great place to get out of the cold to warm up on winter or head for some gifts for yourself or someone else!
127,"worth a trip if you're in toronto. the architecture is beautiful. the stores are pretty much what you will find at any other mall in the GTA-- gap, old navy, h&m, starbucks, etc. eaton centre happens to be very convenient and a very nice place to hang out in the winter, but it does get very crowded and loud. it's so big there are two food courts, although most of the options are just duplicated (hey, i won't argue with having two kernel's in one mall)when i first moved here i was infatuated with eaton centre because it was so novel to have a shopping mall as a city centre. i've gotten sort of fed up with it though, since the prices haven't come down with the rise of the dollar and the stores are very very generic. i don't even bother going here anymore-- i'd rather hold off shopping until i'm on the other side of the border."
128,"Its a great mall.  It has everything but a theatre.  Some of my favourite stores:  BCBG, Indigo, Zara, Victoria Secret, Apple, Coach, Forever 21 and more.Its convenient with a subway stop at Dundas Station and Queen Station.The hours are great and they are open everyday as they are considered a tourist site.  The Urban Eatery is very nice and the food actually tastes good there."
129,"Probably one of my favourite malls of all time. It's literally open almost every holiday when other malls aren't and they've  got so many stores to choose from, especially with all the renovations from the closure of Sears. I'd say there's definitely more high-end stores than there are affordable ones so that's good to keep in mind for budgeting purposes. It's in a great area--the heart or downtown Toronto and across the street from Dundas Square, the Atrium, and is alongside many restaurants. It's also great in the summer time as there are many street festivals in the area. I also like that there a bridge connecting the mall to The Bay, especially during the winter when it's really cold outside. The food court has also been renovated just like what they seem to be doing with every other mall in Toronto. Eatons is always super crowded and is a spot a lot of tourists like to go to due to its location. To avoid the crowds, its best to go earlier during the week at non-peak hours.Even if you can't find something in the mall (which probably highly unlikely) there are many other stores in the area to choose from."
130,dont forget your compass!! Seers is huge still couldnt find a hat though . Friendly staff in all stores
131,"hier kann man sehr gut shoppen gehen. leider ist der kanadische dollar nicht so schwach wie der amerikanische. aber fÃ¼r europÃ¤ische verhÃ¤ltnisse dann doch noch gÃ¼nstig. die mall ist direkt im herzen von toronto. nur ist die mall an sich eher dÃ¼ster. die auswahl an shops ist aber groÃŸartig. fÃ¼r die marken, die man in europa schwer bekommt, shoppt man hier genau richtig!"
132,"being one of the largest malls in Ontario, isn't easy, it comes with some of the highest priced stores in Canada. this mall has been a staple for all sorts of events, which seemingly always makes everyday, a different day, if that makes sense. always something going on, might work better. this mall is also almost always under renovation of some sort, what with sears now out of the picture, that whole ""end"" of the mall is closed for incoming stores. super transit friendly with a subway station on both ends of the mall, plus streetcars and buses accessible on the ground level. best to avoid the upper levels as the higher you go up, the more expensive it is.a good way to kill a day at this mall(with it only being closed twice a year with awesome hours), with lots of shopping and food options available!  lots of parking in the garage, or the surrounding areas."
133,"I used to enjoy hanging out at the Eaton Centre but not as much now.They have the best variety of stores and price level goes up with the floor number. Nothing really interesting though. You can basically find the same stores here and there in other malls around GTA. EC just does a (good) job of putting them together in my opinion.EC is conveniently located in the downtown core so I can access a great selection of dining/shpping options outside on Yonge Street as well. However as a result of the location, more often than not I feel being pushed by the hordes of people so it is not quite a mall to casually take a stroll.And the so-called ""cadillac WIFI"" does not connect half of the time I am here. Ridiculous. The WIFI powered by other stores (Saks and such) is more reliable.I have to admit the mall is well-kept and clean with nice design though."
134,"One of the best shopping/entertainment destinations in Toronto.  In fact it's a must see for anyone visiting Toronto, just like the CN tower! Smack in the middle of downtown on top of two metro stations. Pretty much all major stores are there and surrounded by much more fun things to do along Young Street. It's also an easy walk to Queen West. It's a busy mall though, so if you're not comfortable with people all around you, maybe you should be shopping online."
135,"The Eaton Centre is basically how you know you are in the heart of the city. Located right in Dundas Square and taking you all the way to Queen Street East, this mall is massive in size having 3 full floors of shopping, a massive parking garage, a large food court with tons of variety, and even some offices above it. I've been coming to the Eaton Centre for about 6 years now and although stores I like such as HMV and Bluenotes are no longer here, this is still my go-to shop stop in the city. I come here for stores like Bench, Roots, Hudson's Bay, Foot Locker, Toronto Blue Jays Team Store, Hot Topic, and for the wide variety of food located downstairs which include everything from Chinese, Thai, Kentucky Fried Chicken, to even some sit down restaurants like Joey Eaton. Overall, this is not the best mall Toronto has, it's certainly the most convenient to come to if you are downtown."
136,Huge mall. Good variety of selections esp during the US thanksgiving weekend. Lots of Pokemons too for those playing Pokemon Go. A definite time killer and you can spend/waste so much time there. You get to see the latest styles so you will find some nice deals during sale periods.
137,"Wow! This is quite a mall. Visited on Family Day 2017. I'm not sure I've ever been in a busier mall. Of course many of the area malls were closed for the holiday, so no doubt that increased the crowd even more.I've been to malls with more top-end stores in the US but haven't been to one yet that impressed me more with sheer size. With a labyrinth of a mall like Eaton Centre and an adjoining Saks Fifth Avenue you are bound to find all you need here, and plenty of top-flight stores to boot.This mall is HUGE! Maybe the biggest mall I've ever been in if you count all the nooks and crannies you can walk to without ever stepping foot outside. While we walked from parking at City Hall, the fact that the subway system is connected directly to the mall was great and novel to me.Other people have given you all the logistics and finer details of the mall - I just wanted to add my two cents - color me impressed! Definitely worth a visit when you're in Toronto."
138,"Still has a great selection of stores & now Saks Fifth Ave has opened up next to The Bay. Nordstrom's is due to open in fall 2016 I believe. I can see this place getting even more busy. So I like to shop early on a Saturday morning to avoid crowds. I'm not sure about the food court though. I tried Big Smoke Burger (seems overpriced) & Crepe Delicious (not tasty). I've tried Urban Herbivore in the past which is good but also seems overpriced. I just want something hot, simple, tasty & not costing an arm or leg. I'll try a different place in the food court next time & hope its good."
139,"Huge mall, has everything, great location.  There are restaurants, subway, bus, everything is nearby."
140,"This is a Horton Plaza toned down.  A three level mall with sublevels.  Horton Plaza is located in San Diego and is a crazy labyrinth of narrow walkways and stairs.This was my first Toronto mall experience, and I must admit that I was a little turned off.  People match the low caliber stores.  There were only two landmarks, a fountain and a giant Christmas tree.  I prefer many different things to look at while I'm shopping.They do have an Apple store and a Williams Sonoma which were sufficient to fill my Christmas shopping list.  If you aren't concerned with quality you can almost buy anything you want here, from clothes to toys to cell phones."
141,This is a HUGE mall near downtown Toronto.  I went here about 3 hours before I had to catch a flight home.  I found so much good stuff that I had to expand my carry on luggage and check it just to get it all back to the states.  It's best to go when the dollar to loonie ratio favors the US.  Way more fun to shop when everything is 20% off because of the exchange rate!
142,What do they even have here that no where else has?? Parking is $9/hr. The elevators are ridiculous. There's no selection. Everything's sooo spread apart. Nothing special about this mall besides the fact that it looks nice.
143,"It's a big mall that (probably)has everything you need, making it a one stop shop. But don't expect to be in and out, as it's always jammed with people. Which is why I try to avoid it the best I can. The food court does have a lot of options, however, even with all the seating they have, it's still not enough. Though I'll say I do like the hand wash stations they have set up."
144,Silly me for coming here on Black Friday...total chaos! However the beautiful Xmas decorations had me in ore...love love love!!
145,"Not as good as it use to be it still is located right in the center of downtown Toronto. It has just about every item you can possibly think of but and it has the most trendy fashion around. The down side, is it's always busy and relatively expensive. Still, great place to wander around for a while if you have some free time."
146,"nothing exciting..is it just me, or the stores really have not much stuff to buy.. i mean. they all have lots of stuff, but nothing to buy!! every time i go there!Zara, aritzia,  browns are always messy and full of people, i really don't shop any other store within that mall... just lots of useless stores in my opinion..."
147,This is a kool mall in downtown. I think it's expensive compared to NYC. I was visiting Toronto for the weekend and this mall caught my attention.  Canada doesn't have too many sales.
148,"Every Toronto tourism brochure seems to hype up this place. Like really? You have to come here because it's uniquely Torontonian? I spent three hours here with my cousin as she looked for things that she couldn't find in Japan. After a while, all the stores look the same (Jean Machine, Garage??). My cousin ended up just buying a lipstick from M.A.C because it's cheaper here than in Japan. The clientele is pretty sketchy as well. If you're visiting Toronto, skip it as the shopping mall phenomenon seems to have reached every corner of the world.Good for: killing time, tiring yourself out"
149,"You know the Eaton's Centre is the most visited attraction in Toronto.... I don't know what wanker came up with that figure... but most days it feels very true. I work close to here and most days end up wandering through the mall or at least the food court. Some interesting stores.... but I think I can count the purchases I've made here on one hand. I can't really afford the stores I want to buy from here (Harry Rosen, Johnson and Murphy) so most days I am here its just idle window shopping. I do like the centrally located Indigo here for book browsing and the statues of Canada Goose which guide you in from Queen Street."
150,"Huge shopping centre downtown Toronto. Every type of shop you can think of. Food court is huge and has every type of food you can wish for! Close to subway stations and Yonge Street which is a bit like Oxford Street here in London. Some stores I would recommend are Sears, Smart Set, Aldo and Chapters."
151,"The Hollister at the Eaton centre is terrible, I have been in store 3 times and have had terrible service, all of the employees think are so cool, too cool to talk to you. I saw a cute romper on a manican and asked where  they were and the guy said they sold out, while there was 5 left around the corner. There is always a line up by the change rooms and always a line up for the cash. It is to dark you can barely see the colours. I hate it and I'm never going back to hollister. Abercrombie is just upstairs and has much better service with the same type of clothes!"
152,"Das Eaton Centre ist ein vierstÃ¶ckiges Einkaufszentrum in der Innenstadt von Toronto. Es ist nach der ehemaligen Warenhauskette Eatons benannt. Das Eaton Centre ist mit seinen mehr als 330 LÃ¤den das grÃ¶ÃŸte Einkaufszentrum Ontarios. Insgesamt ist es das drittgrÃ¶ÃŸte Kanadas. Das Eaton Centre ist bequem mit der U-Bahn zu erreichen. Direkt angeschlossene Stationen sind Dundas und Queen. Man kann dort sehr einfach einige Stunden totschlagen. Im Sommer angenehm gekÃ¼hlt, im Winter angenehm beheizt :-)."
153,"The most known mall in Toronto which attracts some of the biggest traffic in all of Canada. Eaton Centre is located right at the heart of Downtown Toronto where Dundas Square and Nathan Phillips Square is.I would recommend taking public transport to the Eaton Centre because you have to pay for parking and to get to the mall from the parking is a hassle for me.Eaton Centre has their shops arranged where the bottom floor generally has the more affordable products, and keeps going up the hierarchy until you reach the top brands located at the top and the food court located at the very bottom. Eaton Centre has the most intense lineups when something hype comes out, but it's probably also one of the first places that will have that item if you're into being the first to buy things that just come out.The design of the mall is a rectangle with a few bizzare odds and ends sticking in and out of it, so it might be a little challenging if you want to go around the escalators, but if you're a commuter and go to the PATH, you're probably a pro at it by now."
154,"Open, light multi story mall downtown.This is a great rainy day activity or full time activity for a shopaholic.  The mall is several stories of atrium with great light and a huge, open feel.  You will see the same stores you see in any  U.S. mall, but it is nice to have them together and right in the middle of Toronto's commercial district."
155,"The Eaton Center is a far cry from what it used to be with the Eaton department store. While I was there the whole place was under construction and no one seems to know exactly how the massive reconstruction is going to turn out. It was still loaded with plenty of stores, but really mostly all chains with everything very much the same as may be found in any mall within the United States, but even with a dollar conversion, generally at significantly higher prices. Access to and from the Toronto Subway system remains very much the same, easy to access and user friendly. As the Eaton Center is huge, maybe the largest center city mall in North America, my hope is that their renovation efforts with again make it a worthwhile center to visit and shop. In the meantime with all of the construction, it is hardly worth while going out of your way to visit."
156,"It's so crazy. The Eaton Centre has a great selection of stores.This place has everything you could need, a great selection of stores in a beautiful, modern, spacious and bright environment. All the employees are all extra friendly and willing to help us when you have any problem.The food court is pretty top notch in terms of quantity - sushi, asian foods, burgers, McDonalds galore, with a massive amount of seating."
157,This place is HUGE. I don't remember how many levels they have. Good place to hang out and window shop or really shop if you are into any of those things.
158,"This is what shopping should be like everywhere. The mall is big, spacious, clean, well lit, and trendy. It also feels premium and expensive. They have so many retailers. You could spend a whole day shopping here and be guaranteed to find what you're looking for. It does a great job at blending higher end stores and more accessible stores. It's definitely worth having a look at if you're in Toronto."
159,"What a great place to people watch in Toronto from a tourist's perspective. I really saw how diverse Toronto is. Not just the mix of backgrounds of the people but groups and couples of different backgrounds. I don't think any city in the US (or any in the world) can measure up.The shopping is decent as well. Good mix of stores for different budgets and product needs (clothes, pharmacy, restaurant, banks etc.). The food court needs more seats though. each time I went there (I was staying at the hotel across the street), the place was packed."
160,"Better than most American malls I've been to simply based on the size and selection, but honestly, I think I remembered this mall better than what it was.  Now that I live in between two cities with a lot more options when it comes to shopping (as opposed to upstate NY when I last travelled to Toronto), it really wasn't as big of a deal as I remembered. Whereas I walked out the mall years ago with bags and bags of new falls clothes, this time, the only thing I walked out with was one bag from La Senza.  Needless to say, I was disappointed, but I guess my tastes have matured past my last visit.  I am more of a boutique-y person now and prefer Yorkville and Queen Street over Eaton Centre any day. If you are visiting the city, of course, it's worth stopping in, but don't make a day of it or anything. This is not the place everyone's talking about when they say ""Toronto has such good shopping!"" This mall's three stars makes since if you are from a city with great shopping... if not, then read this review as a four.  Again - better than any American Mall I've been to (and that includes the Mall of America)."
161,"I haven't been to Eaton for quite awhile. Mainly because I always find the amount of people shopping there on the weekends overwhelming. Two weeks ago when I had to pick up some gifts along the way before going to uptown, I decided to give it another try. OMG!!! For a second, I thought I went back to Asia. SO CROWDED!!! It felt that the entire T.O population was jammed in one mall. I suppose it was because of the xmas season, but still!! Definitely not for people with claustrophobia."
162,"Without a doubt, the mall of downtown Toronto. Imagine they put an actual mall in Manhattan. Well, in a way this is what's happened here since Yonge Street is so similar (but cleaner and nicer). Great mall that's always a destination of mine each and every time I'm in Toronto. Sears on one side (that I almost never visit) and the Bay on the other (which I always visit). In between? A big Chapters, plenty of clothing shops from Harry Rosen to cheap, no frills stuff, a Shoppers Drug Mart, a SportChek, a killer food court, plenty of restaurants inside and outside and a lot more. Since this is the big shopping mecca there's always promotions going on around the mall inside and outside. Last time I got a bunch of free cereal samples. Time before that? Some body lotion. I likey that. They don't even usually do that in LA. Why does Toronto get all the love?"
163,"While I'm not a big fan of malls bring in cities, I was in the area and decided to stop in. First, this mall is very large and can get pretty crowded. Though, they have maps around the mall that allow you to easily navigate the mall. The terminals were also nicely organized so I got around well. They have a variety of stores in this mall including Uni Qlo, Champs Sports, Nike Running, Microsoft, Apple, Foot Locker, Saks and Fifth Avenue and more! While I didn't explore the whole mall, I did not see a food court. Though I did see some food shops like Tim Horton's and Freshii. They also had some food across the street. This mall has water fountains with ice cold water located around the terminals!Some cool features here also include the mall's glass roof and park! I really wish the mall did a better job of communicating on if a store is closed. For example, I was looking forward to going to Uni Qlo, but it was closed for a restock. Altogether, this is a really nice mall that you should check out if you have time while in Toronto!"
164,Lots to see and every store you can imagine so easy to get lost in this mall cause it's massive!
165,"This is a shopping mall, and a very busy and crowded one at that. I'm not sure why it is well-ranked as an ""attraction.""Ranking it three stars because it is clean and has a lot of stores and appears to be a decent mall as far as malls go. As an ""attraction"" for out-of-town visitors, 0 stars."
166,Great store selection but SOO busy! I like the hours - couldn't believe they were open until 9:30pm or maybe even later!
167,"I would never recommend anyone try and do any real shopping here (unless you go when it first opens or right when it's going to close) It's always a zoo, especially during holidays or back to school. You'll get a mega-headache trying to do anything productive. This is especially true if you are going to the Apple store (lined up outside the store), Aritzia (group changerooms during the holidays!), H&M (always a mess) ... However, it is very handy if you only need to do a few quick errands, like stop in at Chapters/Sephora/Shoppers or grab a bite to eat at the food court (I like Freshii/Starbucks). Note - there are TWO foodcourts - the one near Dundas St station is NOT good - it's worth the walk through the mall to the Queen St side. Also, don't eat at Mr. Greenjeans."
168,"Toronto Eatons Centre That's strange there's no longer Eatons store people. It's Sears now. Another anomaly is like the Simpson's Tower on Queen St that the Bay Corporate office is in?  Simpson's is long gone.  Guess there's attachment to the names in the city. Anyways, Toronto Eatons Centre is downtown best mall. Dufferin Mall is the other mall and pales in comparison.Eatons Centre over the past couple years have been undergoing renovations so they are making it better. It's 3 Levels and open on Statutory Holidays. Family Day ~     10 AM - 6 PMGood Friday  ~  10 AM - 6 PMEaster Sunday ~ CLOSEDVictoria Day ~    10 AM - 6 PMCanada Day ~   10 AM - 6 PMCivic Holiday ~  10 AM - 6 PMLabour Day ~    10 AM - 6 PMThanksgiving Day ~ 10 AM - 6 PMChristmas Day ~ CLOSEDNew Year's Day ~ 12 PM - 5PM The highlight of the mall in my opinion would be the new food court, it's snazzy with the modern furniture and has most every cuisine choice there. I would say it's revolutionary cause I never seen anything like it anywhere. Apparantly the cost was $48 million to build.The food court offers real Toronto restaurants, uncommon ones, hand washing stations The design is modern, and food is served on real plates, at one Japanese restaurant there was a classical trio playing?! What the heck. Rest of the mall is standard affair but improving each year however the food court is amazing!"
169,"Eaton Centre is a pretty good mall, it has most of the stores you'd expect, but nothing really stands out about this Mall. Many newer malls boast some type of recreation or attraction and also offer high end dining options, you do t really see that at Eaton Centre. It's downtown Toronto, so it's almost always over crowded and parking can be a bit of an ordeal."
170,"Eaton Centre, a name full of legacy, is still my shopping heaven in Toronto.  I prefer it over Yorkdale Shopping Centre because, despite it being farther from my house, it has more stores that are within my price range.  I visited for Boxing Day shopping.  I parked in the attached parking structure to enjoy the luxury of leaving my winter coat in the car and dropping off the shopping bags periodically.  It only costed $8 for the whole day.  Go beat it, Yorkdale.There are A LOT of stores in Eaton Centre.  There is no designer store such as Louis Vuitton and Hugo Boss here, but Browns, Harry Rosen and Coach are high end enough for me.  I quite enjoy the convenience of buying from both cheaper and expensive stores, all under one roof.  The food court, named Urban Eatery, boosts a large variety.  There are a lot of seating.  There are a few restaurants as well.  If anything to complain, I wish there are more restrooms on each level.  I really enjoyed my Boxing Day shopping experience at Eaton Centre because the stores were generally spacious, and most stores carried a good inventory of sizes and designs.  Most stores offered 50% discount.  :-)"
171,"Das Eaton Cntre leitg sehr zentral in Toronto. Es hat mehrer Stockwerke und ist an das unterirdische Einkaufsnetz angebunden. Es gibt hier nichts was man nicht findet: GeschÃ¤fte aller Art, Schue, Kleidung, Elektronik und im Food Court natÃ¼rlich Fast Food an allen Ecken und Enden. Man kann hier prima einige Stunden verbringen und die letzten Dollars vorm Abflug unters Volk bringen :)"
172,"The Eaton Centre is an absolutely glorious shopping centre if you're going on size, and amount of stores, but apart from that I wasn't overly fond. I liked it, but unfortunately my castmates and I who were staying in Ryerson Uni round the corner made a day out of shopping here, most of which I spent on a couch in Barnes & Noble reading. I did shop, and I did spend a lot of money because some shops aren't the cheapest, but I'm not one to spent all day shopping, and I don't think I could. My favourite thing about the Eaton Centre is the popcorn stand on the bottom floor. I literally came in here once every 2 days when I was in Toronto just to buy a large bag of the extra toffee popcorn; I kid you not it is the best thing on this planet."
173,"HUGE!! LOAD OF SHOPS!! WIDE VARIETY!! Not too sure what it's like now as I was only in Toronto once in my life so for all i know, all of the more popular stores could be gone!"
174,"As the biggest mall in Toronto, the Eaton's Centre has just about everything. Encompassing 3 floors and over 3 blocks of street space it is often quite a bit of a challenge to find your way around. But if you're looking for a day of shopping there is no better place. There are subway stations on either side of the mall (north and south), so getting there is easy. If possible, don't bother parking as the rates are excessive and driving anywhere on Yonge Street can be a bit of a challenge for those who don't know the one way streets.Mall is generally busy, especially on weekends and the weeks before Christmas, so if you don't like crowds give it a miss during those periods. Also make sure you pick up a floor map if you're looking for a specific store. If it's a nice day it's also a good idea to walk out to Yonge and go to the many stores along there."
175,"Decided to to my annual summer trek to this mall on Friday.  100% tourist but it has all the stores you need/want to peruse through.  Although I still classify it as elitist kinda mall since each level is a step up from the next.  The 3rd level has mostly high end stores and of course has less people walking around, the 2nd floor has the mid end stores and generally the most people milling about and of course the first floor is generally where you find the low end, teeny bopper stores..and well where most of the teens are.It's huge, pretty much every store you've heard of and them some you haven't are located here.  They recently renovated all the food courts in here, making it more like the Yorkdale food court (thank god cuz both those food courts looked really bad).  It's more high end and in my opinion suitable to tourists as it provides better options than the fast food picks before. Easy to get to by subway or driving (paid parking lot) or justby walking depending on where you live.  The Sears that was there is no longer there, boarded off.  Sad really, but I hear Nordstrom's will be taking it's place so I'm sure that will generate some new interest.  I do like going at Christmas as well to check out their decorations, they do them well with the huge tree in the centre of the mall, and what would be the Eaton Centre without those iconic birds?  You definitely cannot beat this place for people watching...just choose your level!"
176,"Eaton Center is a one stop shop that made my university days and downtown living so convenient. Their updated late hours (9:30pm) have been a blessing for my last minute shopping and their large selection of stores are awesome.The only downside is that the popularity of the mall means that the best items (during sale periods) sell out fast. Other than that, huge props to Eaton Center for constantly improving the mall (such as the food court, market, Shoppers Drug Mart etc)"
177,"I am not the biggest fan of shopping malls, but I have been to Eaton Centre several times and always had a pleasant experience, also found what I was looking for.It is difficult to find things though, the mall is HUGE!!  But still a good choice if you have time and are prepared to go through hundreds of shops, booths and what not.Also it is nicely decorated on Christmas, worth the visit if you do not mind walking through crowds of people."
178,"A mall with a prime location and many tourists during peak hours- fairly large but poorly designed for the volume of people. Probably why there is often crowds in certain bottle-neck areas when there aren't even that many people.It's a reasonable walk from my office so I'll pop by on weekday mornings if I need to run errands. I refuse to shop here on Fridays or weekends.Decent variety of stores (mix of high and low end), average amenities, and a very out-dated layout."
179,"This mall is constantly a zoo 7 days a week (so many people it's uncomfortable to walk around) so you are better off going to the shops in the PATH, Yorkville, Fairview Mall or Yorkdale Mall to get serious shopping done. Especially the Apple Store, it's the only one downtown and it is always packed. And don't even try to eat at the food court right now, they are renovating the mall right now (as of 2010) and the food court is ridiculously overcrowded (impossible to get a seat)."
180,"This place was packed when I visited on a Monday.  I'm guessing majority of the people were tourists, since I was.The place is decently sized for a mall, and is very modernly designed.  What I love is that it's on a very busy street, so you can walk right out and shop some more since the street is lined with stores as well.  I also saw a lot of incredible fashionable stores in the mall that I've never seen in the states.If I'm ever in Toronto again and need a shopping fix, this is where I'll be."
181,"Bei unserem letzten Besuch in Kanada, waren wir auch in Toronto und haben das Eaton Centre besucht. Freunde hatten es uns empfohlen.Hier bekommt man wirklich eine Menge geboten.Vor allem auch Dinge, die es bei uns in Europa nicht so ohne weiteres gibt.Mehr gibt es eigentlich nich zu schreiben, da meine VorgÃ¤nger schon die wichtigsten Details benannt haben."
182,perfect mall with a good food court and pretty good stores. I have to say that I particularly love the Abercrombie store!
183,"A&F findet man hier. FÃ¼r Touris ein guter Anlaufpunkt, da in anderen StÃ¤dten wie NYC Abercrombie total Ã¼berlaufen ist. Hier kann man ""in Ruhe"" (abgesehen von der extrem lauten Musik) gut einkaufen. Das Sortiment ist relativ gut verfÃ¼gbar und nicht, wie in anderen StÃ¤dten, nur die GrÃ¶ÃŸen S und XL ;-)"
184,A great clean shopping environment. A few of my stores caught my eye not by their brand but their decoration. They have a organize directory like most malls and the food court is like HEAVEN(comparing to New York - New Yorker here). We came on a Saturday morning and parking was $8 for the day which was not bad. We even had a chance to walk to City hall area (approximately 15 minutes walk). We tried not to go in the stores since we basically have most of products in New York and it wouldn't be worth it since Canada's taxes are double. Our focus became what to eat for brunch in Eaton Centre food court. Their was so many varieties and they weren't all fast food. Their food court was so big and clean it was just amazing. It made me think to myself I wouldn't mind living in Toronto and coming here everyday! Would come back for sure c(;(Only con side was around 2-3 it became extremely crowded. Bathrooms was not as clean)
185,"Throwing out a very loosey-goosey 4 stars simply because Vancouver lost its Eaton unfortunately several years ago.Not to mention that this is actually a real mall, in a real DT area with some action; some of the Eatons back home just didn't do too well in surburban areas.But truly, it's a gorgeous mall with its full skylight ceiling across the top floor, and great views of the floors below.  This is gigantic, comparable to our Burnaby's Metropolis.At ground level, the food court is also quite impressive---in terms of decor, which I can't say much of the typical, boring franchise eateries here.  Just thank goodness to my expense account, that I wouldn't spend this kind of $ on fast food, how these students can afford it is astounding.Designer names-wise, does have its Harry Rosen, but no stand alone like Tiffany, Zegna, etc, probably Kate Spade was the best I saw.  Your usual Eddie Bauer, Michael Kors, etc.Like how the Dundas station easily connects here too."
186,"The Toronto eaton centre is absolutely huge! It also holds concerts and shows sometimes.All of the stores are popluar brands in the province of Ontario, the showrooms just bigger then your regular mall ones. However this eaton centre has included Victoria Secrets showroom. They even have the pink edition as well. Theres a couple of maps every corner or so you can keep a track of yourself. And escalators and stairs are conviniently located so you dont have to walk much lost to go up or down. Lastly, the open sky glass idea was a really nice touch to the splendid architecture of the building. A good tourist spot :)"
187,"Great Variety of Stores . I personally like Abercrombie and Fitch and The Apple Store! The food court is bleh , and the Italian restaurant with the lasagna and pasta and  stuff are ripoffs and their lasagna tastes like cardboard."
188,"I'm not sure if I like this mall or hate this mall.  What I like about this place the most: it's right above the subway, so easy access in the winter, the Urban Eatery has a huge selection of fast food which was unique a few years back, but now it's becoming common place.  The selection of shops is great. What I hate about this mall: It's too busy, and parking is impossible to find.  Verdict: Come here during non-peak times (i.e. not Black Friday, not X'mas) and its convenient if you work in the downtown core.  If you live in the 'burbs, there's no point coming here, just go to Yorkdale, Square One or Vaughan Mils where parking is much easier to find."
189,"If you can find your way out of the labyrinth surrounding the Subway entrance to the Mall proper, there's lots of good shopping to be had. (Apple Store FTW)More maps and info kiosks are sorely needed!"
190,"When my friend first moved to Toronto, he mentioned this great and enormous underground mall that I had to visit when I came to Toronto. It was the Eaton Centre. I came here on two occasions during my four day visit to Toronto. I was not impressed. It is a mall. It is a big mall, but still a mall. Nothing too interesting or exciting about it for me. I guess the fact that it is underground makes a difference in the blazing summer heat or freezing winter. Otherwise, I did not see what the big deal was about this mall."
191,"i usually like it here, there are many stores i frequent and have bought most of my clothes and gifts for other people in this mall. it has always been dependable for a good time. the location is so great, it's close to work, close to other entertainment, accessible directly with subway.. etc. i don't know if I like that the stores are being moved all over the place. I felt a bit lost (and had a mini heart attack) when i didn't see the store right where i remembered it. they moved it across the hall!! the new food court is a lot better than before. Ate there a handful of times, pretty impressed. it's a big shopping mall in the center of the city, who doesn't like shopping?"
192,A pretty impressive mall in my book. It was in a very convenient location in downtown Toronto. Lots of stores and definitely a lot of selection in the food court.
193,"I, being born and bred in the GTA, have been visiting this mall for a long time.  Not to say, I actually like this mall, but it's a great place to meet up with close friends and then use it as a temperature controlled starting point for exploring this city.  Go elsewhere for a less stressed, less expensive and less corporate shopping experience.Layout:  There seriously needs to be more signage for the areas of the mall.  Most people won't know that the food court area is either on the lowest level or on the front, just below McDonald's.  There are three levels to the mall, and most of them are confusing as heck.  It's like being a rat in a maze - and after the renovation, it's no better - the stores have been shifted around, and it feels like the developers are playing a very complicated trick on the customers!Stores:  Pretty generic, with all the big names filling in a roll call.  You have Disney, H&M, Bell World, Apple, Abercombie and Fitch, and all the usual suspects.  The stores are on the high end side, with a emphasis on clothing, accessories and anything wearable.  Don't get your big budget electronics here, as it is difficult to find anything that specializes in the stuff.Bathrooms:  Few and far between.  The women's washrooms are always full and always crowded.  A big mall should have spacious, gorgeous washrooms for the customers.  These washrooms are very claustophobic, crowded and small feeling.  They also don't have hooks on the doors for women's bags/purses or purchases - so very clumsy!Location:  Smack dab in the middle of the city.  It's close to touristy destinations like the PATH, City Hall, Old City Hall, and Winter Gardens and Elgin Theatre.  Best thing about this mall is that is accessible by walking, bus, streetcar and subway.People:  Oh good grief.  This mall is usually packed with teens, tourists and business people looking for a quick bite or a quick buy.  This means that you'd either be annoyed at the princesses carting around Daddy's credit card and gossipping, or just avoiding the tourists who are looking at the displays and the Flying Geese formation at the Queen St. exit.Decorations:  There are a couple of landmarks in this mall.  The ""Flying Geese"" formation hanging from the ceiling at the Queen St. entrance.  A giant water fountain that spews a great gout of water up to the third storey - very impressive to watch, although it takes forever to fill up and do so.  During Christmas, there's a huge tree in the center of the mall.  I also love the natural light because of the glass ceilings/skylights.Parking:  Terrible, although there is a closed garage for you to head into.  I haven't used the garage in a long while, although - it costs a pretty penny!"
194,"I was very excited to visit the Eaton Center after hearing about all the new stores that popped up. I had a tough week and was ready to shop my sorrows away and rack up some serious debt. But I couldn't! I was basically wearing my credit card on my sleeve, and all I ended up buying was Aveda Shampoo! New stores as current date that I was very excited to see at Eaton Center:1. Juicy Couture. I am not talking about their expensive fleece/sweat wear that came into popularity when I was in OAC (showing my age...I went to high school when there was still a grade 13!!) Juicy has some serious Marc Jacobs-like clothes that make one all chique. But I was so disappointed when I walked in! The front half of the store is dedicated to sunglasses and accessories (blech) and then the end-part of the store has one wall dedicated to Juicy's fleece suits on fancy hangers (which have been around in existence for almost 10 years). The other wall has very boring clothes. Either I just picked the wrong season to go in, or this is as good as it gets for us. Disappointed.2. Massimo Dutti. I could not WAIT for the higher-end Zara store to arrive. I still have some of my fave Grace Kelly-esque dresses and coats I got from MD in Spain. The store layout is very Ralph Lauren...with dark woods, equestrian-like dÃ©cor all around. The store is split into Men's and Women's. If you are looking for basic black, grey and dark clothing priced at around $200 then this is your store. Boring as heck.3. J Crew. I usually get my basic J Crew sweaters, coats, shirts and pants at the huge outlet in Florida. I didn't find that much difference in style but big difference in price. In other words, I can't in good conscience buy J Crew clothing here, but I have to say, the store layout is very nice!4. Harry Rosen. Newly renovated and nice and big and modern and all for just-Men! My dad went nuts here and bought a great Etro coat. Anywhoo, excited to see all these new stores. Although this time around I couldn't get anything, I can always count on Zara for basics, Aveda for my shampoo, and the mall's closest proximity to my fave Chinese restaurant:)"
195,"If you are from a small town you'll love the Eatons Centre... God knows I did when I first moved to Toronto at 18. Unfortunately the nostalgia has worn off. Don't get me wrong, the selection in stores at the Eatons Centre is pretty good. Most stores are here and they have the best Apple and The Bay in town. Apart from those two stores, you are better off shopping along Queen West or Yorkville. Major flagship stores (which usually get exclusive lines) tend to be on one of those two streets and have better selections."
196,"Big mall with lots of generic American and international stores ie Gap, Old Navy, Zara, Sears (really? Sears?!), H&M. LululemonConvenient locaiton; Dundas subway is right there, connected to mall. Good if you're looking for a mall with everything. Otherwise, doesn't really have a lot of character."
197,"Big ass mall in a busy ass area. Tons of shops big and small and a shiny and large cafeteria. They always seem to be renovating. Lots and lots of people come here, from tourists to locals to students. There are tons of weirdos as well, especially outside near the entrances. It's just busy, like all of the time. Especially in the summer weekends. It is easily accessible by TTC subway. I'm not sure why you'd go out of your way to come here unless you really need something you think they'll have."
198,"The main shopping mall of Toronto is chock full of shopping options. Some of my favorites were the Apple store, Best Buy and Sony Style. It also host The Gap,Skechers, Starbucks, Williams-Sonoma,Zara and hundreds of other stores. Definitely check it out when you need to empty your wallet on some  Canadian shopping."
199,"Nothing.. Absolutely Nothing compared to the 'malls' over here in the UK, going here is like a damn day trip. There was 25 of us at the start of the day, 14 by lunchtime and 7 got out. You do the maths.Was a laugh, had some good food, and got a nice discount on some trainers. Just the size can be a little off-putting especially with the young ones."
200,"I have developed a slight mall aversion due to my years and years of working retail. Most times I would rather do pretty much anything in the world than go to a mall. Real talk. But I don't mind this mall at all.You can find pretty much anything you could want here in terms of fashion, housewares, gifts, etc. The stores range from moderately priced to upscale. I can see how this would be a big draw to tourist peeps, given the DT location.Parking is redonk expensive and also cars are frequently broken into there (my mom's has been a few times) so I recommend you take the TTC if you can.It is AWESOME that the subway is right underneath all of the madness, so I can make a quick escape as soon as I get the ""no more mall for me"" feeling!"
201,"I've spent a ridiculous amount of time in the Eaton Centre. In fact, during this visit alone, I've swung by two days out of three. It's not because I'm a shopaholic, but rather because I just love being in the Eaton Centre.I love how spacious it is, I love the variety of stores, I love the multiple levels and I love sitting by the fountain and people watching.The only strike that the Eaton Centre has against it in my books is that things are always more expensive at the Eaton Centre than they are anywhere else. Even if it's the same store and the same product, you will pay more for it just because you are buying it in the Eaton Centre. That's not cool."
202,"Eaton Centre is the tourist mall located in the heart of Downtown right at Yonge & Dundas. Don't really know what to say it's just a mall. There's an Apple Store, a food court with an A&W. It's a pretty big mall. It has all of the chain stores you would expect. Decent mall for somebody coming from outside of town but as a local it isn't anything special."
203,"massive shopping centre near dundas in toronto, well worth a visit. I stayed at the comfort suites round the corner, and went to the eaton centre just about every day, and I still didnt see it all Toronto is an amazing city, and raton is a great way to shop when the weather outside is not so good toronto rocks oh and the hot dog seller outside the main entrance is the best in canada"
204,I have been going to the eaton centre since I was a child. They have some great stores there. The one thing I hate about this mall is the layout.
205,"For an American, this mall is stupendous! Being a New Yorker, i dislike malls a lot because in the US, they tend to be extremely sterile and strictly suburban in character. Of course, as most things are done better in other countries, this mall is much better than most American malls. There is definitely a fun, urban vibe that pervades here, and i love the stores that i can not find at home like Jack Jones. The H&M here also seemed to carry slightly different stock and more scarves which i loved, and purchased! PS- from what i read this is Toronto's number 1 attraction. Sad but true in a big city that has a lot more than a mall to offer, but nevertheless an interesting fact! Shopahoics and fasionistas must visit here!"
206,"Hmm... How should I put this...? --Eh. I don't think I can really be fair about this review because I've been blessed with living less than 1 mile away from Valley Fair Shopping Mall + Santana Row...The best part about this mall was the shooting water display in the middle of the mall. I think I spend 20 mins there! Hahaha...Other than that, the stores are okay. I guess you can find what you are looking for since they have something for everyone. I'm not really feeling the structure of the mall. It's just 1 straight line with a few weird stairways to confuse you on how to get from 1 floor to the next.I think I left in less than 1 hr."
207,"The nicest urban mall I ever visited, the Eaton Centre is downtown Toronto's foremost shopping mall experience. Shoppers congregate daily to shop at the hundreds of stores that make up the mall's tenants. With Sears, Indigo Books, and H&M being the largest stores at the mall, there's always something for someone here. With a large food court and many kiosks and booths throughout the complex, the mall is connected to both Queen and Dundas Street subway stations on the TTC's subway line. A pedestrian tunnel connects the store to The Bay store located on Queen Street. If you're looking for high-end shopping (Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Holt Renfrew) then this is not the place to shop as Bloor Street West should be your shopping destination."
208,Forgot to mention. You can get off at the Dundas station and there is an exit that takes you right into the mall.
209,"Great place to shop if you happen to be downtown They have a wide variety of stores, you can almost find all the stores here.  It gets super crowded on weekends."
210,"Fossil store had the nicest retail associates ever. I was not pressured into buying anything yet they let me browse, and they explained to me what's good or bad about some items in the store. Next time I'm buying something, I'd definitely pay Fossil a visit."
211,"Toronto Eaton Centre is definitely worth the trip. The mall is HUGE and be prepared for a lot of walking. It gets really busy on the weekends and you should come early to avoid big crowds and pushy people. The overall layout is fairly easy to navigate and there isn't much bad I can say about this place. Overall, really nice mall to visit and I'm sure you'll have a blast while your there."
212,"Even at the Mall of America, the West Edmonton Mall, and this modernly designed and spacious Eaton Centre, the shopping experience soon becomes similar to any other big mall. Or in the immortal words of the Talking Heads - ""Same as it ever was!""The Eaton Centre does offer some positve exceptions, even considering the national demise of its namesake several years ago.  The Hudson Bay store on one end is a fine department store that wears its age and history well.  And when you consider all the other activities that Toronto has to offer within walking and transit distance, the Eaton Centre is just another interesting and fun choice within this vibrant metropolitan area.  Most interesting is Trinity Square which is literally just outside the door near Sears and on the opposite side from Yonge.  After purchasing your ""graven images"" in the mall, spiritual peace and maybe redemption awaits you just a few steps away."
213,"Pas mal comme centre commercial, on y trouve Ã  peu prÃ¨s toutes les grandes enseignes de vÃªtements et produits culturels.C'est un peu comme ChÃ¢telet les Halles sans le labyrinthe de couloirs voire plus les 4 temps Ã  La DÃ©fense.Le plus c'est le food court que vous trouverez Ã  peu prÃ¨s dans tous les centres commerciaux de ce type. On y sert tout type de cuisine dans un modÃ¨le ""restauration rapide""."
214,"Me, personally. I hate malls; that includes the Eaton Center as well. They are nothing more than a capitalist mirage and it's packed with people like teenage girls with daddy's credit card and loners."
215,"It's busy. Everyone says that but I have to say that it's not exactly a good mall for anyone who has a stroller, not to mention a double stroller.  They are currently renovating it so there is a whole section where the Sears was being built. I would suggest only going there to the sake of experiencing a tourist trap."
216,"It's an A-OK mall. You've got all the special stores like Apple, Sephora, Indigo, Club Monaco, but nothing special. There's one giant water fountain on the lower level, but that's about it. There was a shooting here a few years ago that made Toronto headlines, so not exactly the safest mall on earth. Go with an idea of what you want to buy and don't wander. Washrooms are despicable and the food court is even worst with MSG-laced food. Get in and get out. If you're looking for a mall to stroll in, go to the Yorkdale Mall, it's definitely a few stars higher than this downtown zoo."
217,"Average mall with okay quality shops. The mall looks awesome. The food court is awesome for a quick bite but that's about it.  If u want to shop, I wouldn't go here"
218,"Like most Torontonians, I have a complicated relationship with TEC. I like to shop local* whenever I can, but there are certain things you have to go to a mall for, like Apple or Microsoft products, see a Bell person in the flesh or the classic: it's shit outside and I need an outfit for such and such an occasion right. Now.  I have to give TEC credit for their sparkly holiday decorations and the no-need-to-see-daylight abilities to get to the Bay, the TTC and The Path at large. I also give them credit for (mostly) sticking to the old English way a mall or department store is assembled, by putting the fanciest shops on top, and tiering down from there. Lest we forget the Urban Eatery. Sometimes mall Chinese, NYF or A&W are the only things that will satisfy you, and they are all housed in the brand new, environmentally friendly Urban Eatery. Who doesn't love root beer in a giant glass mug? Only fools. *Shameless Plug: Have you taken the pledge yet? 'Tis the season... http://www.yelp.ca/events/toronto-yelp-shops-local-2"
219,"It's a crazy large mall. Great for shopping and hanging out with friends (at their food court). However, on a busy weekend, it can get really insane. They have multiple level parking but it gets full in no time. If you are lucky, you will find some space on the roof in open (Level 5 I think). It is terribly crowded inside as well. I met a couple of friends there on a weekend and it was pouring with people like ants. The food court is large but then sometimes you run out of space there as well. Overall, a great place to hang out and shopping. Try non-crowded times like weekdays or morning-early afternoons on weekends."
220,"Toronto Eaton Centre is the hallmark of Shopping and Offices in Toronto, and is located quite literally in the Centre of the city, just next to City Hall in fact.The selection of shops for clothing, food, electronics, sundries, etc. etc. is simply fabulous.  The mall is bright and cheerful and offers something for everyone.There is an art display of ""the Birds"" that is quite famous for people taking photos at the south side of the building (by Queen St) and in the Centre of the mall is a great Fountain that shoots water up in to the air up to the 3rd storey.The building is easily accessed by either the Dundas or Queen St subway stations, and spans the distance between them."
221,"I used to work at this Mall and live 2 streets down, Some of the same ladies I used to work with and surrounding stores, theyre still there so kindof feels like a home away from home type of deal. Its a large mall with MANY MANY stores and options especially since they opened the new urban eatery downstairs. Its like taste of fast food world haha. They got Thai Express, Jimmy the Greek, Some italian ones, Subway and many others. New Victoria Secret store is my absolute fave, Everytime I walk in there, i spend no less then $100, no girl can have enough bra,thongs or glitterly body lotions and oh Sephora aswell. The Apple Store is also great, tons of smart nerdy yet good looking boys are there to help you as quick as possible, its always packed so except pushing and a lot of excuse me's. All major cell phone companys are at the mall aswell, Wind, Bell, Fido, Telus and Rogers, they have stands in the middle of the mall and their actual store located nearby or around. Shoe Got Busted randomly at the mall? Have no fear, theres an amazing shoe repair guy located near the Queen Station exit beside Nino D'Arena and Body Shop, He will fix your shoe in less then half an hour. This man sees me like 4-7 times a year haha.As usual, tons of clothing stores, Zara, Mendocino, Club Monaco, Lacoste, Le Chateau, Michael Kors, Guess, Bebe,,,etc and lods of Hair Salons and some spas for nails and styling.The Bay is also right across from the mall, obsessed with that store, if the Mac makeup store store is too full at the mall, go across to the Mac boutique at the bay for more informative help without feeling rushed."
222,It was almost like a ghost town in the mall today.  I thought for sure with it being a long weekend I would be fighting the crowds but no.  The only store that was even remotely crazy was Old Navy because they had a big sale on.There seems to be a lot of renos happening right now.  H&M has a chunk of their store closed off.  RW&Co is closed for a remodel.  There are also a few others.
223,"I was wondering: Where the heck is everyone on a Saturday afternoon in Downtown Toronto?  Well they were all at the mall!  They have everything in here.  It is not just one Gap or Forever 21, they have more than one. They are quite far away from one another too.  This place is super big and the ceiling is magnificent.  It is also connected to the Saks across the street.  They have something for everyone and tourist should just walk through and look at the beautiful architecture if you are not shopping."
224,"The mall is at the heart of downtown Toronto and is always busy all year round. They have everything ranging from pharmacies, to a high end food court that uses real plates and cutlery (although I wonder how many forks get stolen every day), and retail stores (of course). There are office buildings above as well so you'll see a mix of shoppers and 9-5 business people in the mall during the weekdays.The good:It's always clean and there's a good security presence since a shooting that took place here a few years back. There have been tons of renovation to improve the look of the mall and a few still ongoing. Tons of selection to choose from.The bad:Homeless / drunk people frequent the mall (my guess is to window shop). Parking is available but is paid parking (downtown of course). Can get crowded at times.Overall the Eaton Centre is a mall I visit almost every day as I work and live within walking distance to it. It's a great place to get everything that you need."
225,"It's a big mall with stores ranging from your $ brands to your $$$$ brands. I love the giant Bay along the Queen st. end and the new Nordstrom is pretty nice. There's tons to eat and walk around here at this mall so you can definitely kill some time (and calories) walking around here. The stores are quite a decent size so you're getting quite a selection at every store you visit. I like that I can pick up almost anything here. It's indoors and connects the Queen and Dundas subway lines so you can literally take the subway to the other side of the mall... though why would you...hahaBathrooms are cleaned pretty often and the Urban eatery, though almost always busy, has an abundance of seating. Well maintained mall :)It's a pretty busy mall and usually opened for holidays too! Because of it's large size though, it makes it easy to walk through without really having to worry about the crowds. I would be careful though because there's security incidents here quite often. I use to go to school nearby so I go through the Eatons on a daily basis. Sometimes you have some violent out bursts from random people coming into the mall (or ones that seem to just hang out here all day...), and though there's usually security stationed everywhere, I'd just be more alert."
226,"There are only five reasons to ever, ever go here, and even those are stretching it. Malls in general are despicable places and this one tops the list with an unfathomable amount of size 00 clones traipsing aimlessly through the mall waving around daddy's credit card and drifting in and out of Bench/Hollister/A&F/Aerie/Le Chateau giggling and gossiping. Every store in this mall can be found in a more tolerable (outdoor) setting that doesn't set you back $20 in parking - H&M, Sephora, Banana Republic, MAC, etc. The worst part about this sterile, uninspired environment is those insipid, pushy salespeople that line the centre aisles of the mall shilling their horrible wares - you know the ones: the fake hairpieces, shitty/gypsy hair straighteners and flame-adorned clothing.Reasons to go here (there are five): * Mrs. Field's soft pretzels (sadly, one of the only soft pretzels to be found in Toronto. At least they're good)* Blue Marine & Co.: Soia & Kyo brand winter coats* Carlton Cards: $0.25 helium balloons* Jean Machine* As a winter shortcut to walk between Dundas & Queen (it's always open to pedestrians)"
227,"What's a trip to Toronto without shopping?Pretty much all the major stores you could need are found here, and it is close to restaurants downtown as well.It can get very busy and crowded.Make sure to wear comfortable shoes, as you will be walking a lot around the area!"
228,"As far as malls in Canada go, this one is top notch. It has a lot of selection in one place and a lot of great and unique places to eat. There is a good mix of high end stores (Ted Baker, Michael Kors, Coach) to inexpensive stores (Zara, H&M, Hollister).The Good:1. Selection. There really is something for everyone here. Eaton Centre boasts a lot of great stores.2. Food. There are lots of places to eat and the places to sit are unique and quite comfortable.The Bad:1. Busy. This place is always super busy, especially on weekends. It's a hub for annoying tourists who don't understand universal escalator protocol.2. Layout. The layout is not the best, especially now that Sears is gone and you can't stroll through there to get to Dundas street (you need to go down a level or two then go back up).Recommendation: visit the mall on off hours and during the week. Your head will thank you!"
229,"First off, let me start off saying that I LOVE shopping. I will go out of my way to visit a mall to find good shopping. The mall still has some construction going on (way less though compared to during the summer) and can get extremely busy at times. The store selection is good, but the sales are nothing too fantastic. Its a good mall, but there is nothing really too special about it. However, visitors beware, during peak times (i.e. on weekends or mid-summer) there are a TON of tourists...just FYI."
230,"I learned something very important while in Toronto....There are a lot of malls. There has to be at least one mall every 100 feet.  It's crazy.  And the craziest of them all is the Eaton Centre.  Honestly, yes, it's massive, yes, it has hundreds of stores, but in the end, it's just a mall, and I can't justify giving a mall more than 3 stars.  There is a nice assortment of stores to fit everyone's taste.  And I assume in the winter one doesn't want to have to trapeze all over town just to go shopping, so the Eaton Centre is perfect.  Definitely something to check out if you are visiting Toronto"
231,"I stayed in the One King West Hotel and through the hotel there is an underground passageway that leads into the underground historical district. Through that district, I was able to navigate my way to the Eaton Centre. I later found out that it would have been SO much easier to have just gone from the street and follow Yonge street all the way down but that's neither here nor there. I really liked this mall. There was everything I needed in a big shopping mall like this. I found really really good deals but then again, it might just be that the US Dollar was so strong and maybe that may have had an influence on my views but nonetheless, I liked the deals here. I suggest not going to the upper floors as my experience was that they are retailers who deal with the more financially lucky out of us all.. unless of course you're looking for that kind of thing. What I liked most was all the Holiday decorations they had up. The giant tree and those huge deer/elk, they made the place look really magical."
232,I live two blocks from the mall so it's easily within walking distance.  It's a good size mall with a variety stores for everyone.  You won't be disappointed.
233,"One of the busiest malls in Toronto, but for good reason: great variety of stores (both high and low end), parking, accessible by public transit, and great food court that offers lots of variety."
234,"Huge huge mall! Almost as big as Yorkdale..You can find almost all major clothing retailers in this mall. The best part is that it's usually open during the holidays as well.That being said, it is almost always busy."
235,"Eaton Centre is one of the largest malls in Toronto where its considered to be a ""travel must go"" since it's open 365 days a year..This mall has almost everything and anything you are looking for. European Brands, Canadian Brands..you name it..it's most likely in this mall...(don't quote me on it tho)Weekends and holiday season is very packed..cuz its open when other places aren't...parking is expensive if you must drive here...it's at a TTC stop, I wouldn't drive here...public transit isn't that bad (sometimes) especially when you're downtown...people pay soo much to live here because of convenience...This is a huge mall to walk in, one day is really not enough if you shop at every availible store in this mall...so of the stores really just carry the same items...ie. Aritzia and TNA? seriously? Is it necessary to have both stores here? Hollister and A&F? same corporation...just different labels..you get the idea..."
236,I am terrified of heights. My boss and I traveled to Toronto for a business conference and were wanting something to do in the evening. This is what we chose to do. The elevator ride to the top was quick and the views from the top were stunning. This is for sure a must do/see for anyone visiting the city.
237,"The Eaton Centre is a nice mall.  Nice and bright, and in the downtown core.  Sometimes it's a little overwhelming, but it's a good place to stop if you need something."
238,"Sure it's the flagship mall of downtown Toronto and while I do walk through it or use it to kill some time often I am not overly impressed by anything it has to offer, their renovations didn't really seem to do much and the only thing great about it is the revamped food court. But it has a few stores that have 2 outlets in the same mall, most of the shops can also be found in a 10minute walk down queen street and all I see this is it being a very touristy spot that has little to offer for locals. Unless of course you're looking for a sears or apple store.But it's big and pretty to walk around thanks to the long open roof letting all the sun in."
239,"So much shopping. Some unique stores and some typical mall stores. The interesting thing about it is the path, which I can't wait to explore more of. It seems like it goes everywhere. Also people here seemed to be friendly and helpful."
240,I only go during weekdays or weeknights as it gets very crowded easily. They do offer all the shops I need in one spot and easy access to get to with TTC.
241,"Three floors of shoppes. THREE FLOORS of them. That is what this place is. If you like shopping at major retailers, this is one place to do it. The indoor mall is usually filled to the brim with people. To my recollection I can't think of one particularly great store that stood out for me. They have the usual, like Foot Locker, Forever 21, H&M, Sears, etc. At the time I was just enthralled at the prospect of having 3 floors of shoppes to stroll through. Now, looking back at it, most of those shoppes are ones I can drive to closer to home than making a trip cross-country for.  If you are in Toronto, you should visit this place, just to say you were there. If you are thinking of going to Toronto, this place should NOT tip the scales for a reason to go there. Oh, and FYI- I'm going to be SUPER nice and tell you that Yonge is pronounced Young. Americans look silly as hell when they say- ""yawn-g?""."
242,You can find everything in this mall but it's always so packed with people it tires me out. They need more and bigger/cleaner washrooms here.
243,"It almost hurts to give a mall 2 stars... especially one that's at the heart of a major city. But c'mon Toronto, I'm sick of paying for parking... I'm a patron. Why isn't that good enough?!!The website makes this place seem very sophisticated, upscale, bourgie... but it's not. I think that was the disappointing part. It was so typical.Yes, you can find a ton of stores here. It's a one-stop-shopping-spot as all malls are, but it's not much more than that.Sigh. I prefer Yorkdale."
244,"I walked through the Eaton Centre recently and will be walking through here soon but there seems to have been a lot of construction to really ramp the place up.  There is nothing spectacular about the mall, I mean there is no crazy niche market the mall is going after and there is no theme park inside.It's a mall with a bunch of popular stores in the heart of Toronto that is easily accessible via subway, streetcar, bus or walking.  If you dare to drive into this area there is parking in and around the mall.The mall is pretty popular with anyone who is in this area which is usually people working, tourists and most likely kids and teens.The mall has undergone a bit of construction and they have a lot of connections to the Best Buy, the subway and a new food court.If you haven't finished your Christmas shopping you might not want to drop in unless you're willing to brave out the large crowds!"
245,It's a mall.  A great place to escape the winter cold of Toronto.  I use it a lot to cut through instead of walking inside either to get to the financial district or simply to get to Dundas/Bay area
246,"The shopaholic in me jumped for joy when I found out I was staying so close to Toronto's biggest mall.  And I jumped even higher when I found out the currency exchange difference from USD to CAD (It's not a big difference, but for someone who loves to shop, it was definitely a plus!).The mall itself is HUGE.  3 floors filling up 3 street blocks, 330+ stores and restaurants, and several entrances/exits coming from Yonge, Dundas, Queen, and James.  There's a wide selection of different stores, from stores that you can find in the US (Aldo, Juicy Couture, Stuart Weitzman, ZARA, Coach, Victoria's Secret, etc.) in addition to Canadian stores (Dynamite, Chateau, etc.).  Basically, there are all of the chain mall stores that you would expect.  Although we didn't eat here, there was also a wide selection of places to eat in the Urban Eatery food court."
247,HUGE MALL! This shopping centre has everything you would need in one location. Very crowded and full of people. Not recommended if you like quite shopping.
248,It's a great mall! I enjoyed visiting Toronto and going shooing at this mall! I was spending time with my friend here. Great store selection I loved the fashion they have here!
249,"A huge mall smack dab in the middle of downtown Toronto ain't too bad. Almost every major American and Canadian retailer you can think of has a place in here and independent shops as well. It is hard to miss this mall and not go in there because it is huge! If you're visiting from the States, I wouldn't recommend buying anything unless you really have to because every brand name item in there is at least 2 times the price of what you'll normally see, even after sale. The inside is quite nice, especially the glass ceiling and the Canadian flag hanging makes it look more symbolic. I recommend looking from the north side of the 3rd floor of the mall, which is where all the higher-end stores (Juicy Couture, Stuart Weitzman, Williams-Sonoma, Sears [if that's considered HE]). Stop by once if you're visiting, don't stop by if you're from around. The layout of the mall is really nice but unless you like indoor shopping, you can find these stores all over."
250,"The other reviewers have pretty much summed up this mall but one thing they didn't mention and that drives me crazy is that there is nowhere to sit! My feet are tired after several hours of shopping and now I'm sitting on the floor. They need benches, badly."
251,It's like Rideau in Ottawa. You have to pay for parking if you are downtown.
252,I didn't feel like a tourist as I admired the ceiling.  I like being here on a rainy day.  It is very clean and looks great.  The design is good.  We went here for the food court.
